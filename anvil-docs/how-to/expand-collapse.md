# [Expand and collapse sections using components](#expand-and-collapse-sections-using-components)

Components can be shown and hidden by setting their `visible` property to `True` or `False`. Showing or hiding a [container](/docs/client/components/containers) such as a ColumnPanel shows or hides the components within it, allowing you to create expandable/collapsable sections of pages.

You can use this technique to make the contents of a Data Grid cell expandable/collapsable.

[Here’s an example app](https://expandable-stock-chart-grid.anvil.app) showing a Data Grid full of stock data. There’s a column containing a time-series chart for the price of each stock. The chart is hidden by default, and it can be shown by clicking a Link.
