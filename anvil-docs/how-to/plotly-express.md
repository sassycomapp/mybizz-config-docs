# [Using Plotly Express to build your figures](#using-plotly-express-to-build-your-figures)

In this guide, you will learn how to use Plotly Express in Anvil, by creating figures on the server side and feeding them to plots on the client side. If you’re interested in using other plotting libraries, take a look at our [Making plots](/docs/how-to/plot) guide.

## [Construct the figure](#construct-the-figure)

The first thing we need to do is to create our UI and place a Plot component on it.

Now, we need to build the plot that is going to be displayed inside our component. Most Python libraries do not work on the client side, so we won’t be able to use Plotly express directly in our client Form. Instead, we will create our figures on the [server](/docs/server) and then send them to the client.

If you want to learn more about the difference between client and server code, and why some libraries are only available to the server, check out our [Client vs Server Code](/articles/client-vs-server) in Anvil explainer.

In this guide, we’re going to be plotting data from the [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), included in the `plotly.express.data` package. Let’s start by creating a Server Module and, at the top, importing Plotly Express. After this, we need to create a function in which we’ll build and return our figure, and we’ll decorate it as `@anvil.server.callable`.

```python
import plotly.express as px

@anvil.server.callable
def create_fig():
    data = px.data.iris()
    fig = px.scatter(data, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", trendline="ols")
    return fig
```

## [Display the figure in your UI](#display-the-figure-in-your-ui)

Go back to your client form code and call your server function inside the `__init__` method. This will output the function that we created as a [Media Object](/docs/working-with-files/media), which we can set as the figure method of our plot component.

```python
  class Form1(Form1Template):
      def __init__(self, **properties):
          super().__init__(**properties)

          fig = anvil.server.call('create_fig')
          self.plot_1.figure = fig
```

When you run your app, your figure will be displayed inside your Plot component.

From this point, you could add some layout customization or continue building figures within your server function to feed into more plots.
