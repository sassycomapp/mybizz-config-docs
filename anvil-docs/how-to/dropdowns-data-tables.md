# [Connecting a DropDown component to a Data Table](#connecting-a-dropdown-component-to-a-data-table)

A common use case for the [DropDown component](/docs/client/components/basic#dropdown) is to populate it with rows from a [Data Table](/docs/data-tables). This how-to guide will show you how to populate a DropDown component with rows from a Data Table then write back to a Data Table after making a selection.

The example app in this guide is a simple suggestion box. Users add feedback to a TextArea component and choose a category from a DropDown. A row is then added to the Data Table with the feedback and selected category.

## [Step 1: Create Data Tables](#step-1-create-data-tables)

You’ll first need a Data Table in your app. In this example, we have two Data Tables: `categories` and `suggestions`.

`Categories` has one text column called `name` with three rows: `Comment`, `Criticism` and `Warning`

The second Data Table, `suggestions`, is where the we’ll store the user feedback. We’ll need two columns: one for storing the feedback added to the TextArea component and one for the category selected in the DropDown component. The first column should be a text column called `text`. The second should be called `category` and should be a [link to the `categories` Data Table](/docs/data-tables/links-between-tables).

## [Step 2: Build the User Interface](#step-2-build-the-user-interface)

Next, we’ll build the user interface for our example app. We’ll need to add a Card, two Labels, a TextArea, a DropDown and a Button to our Form. Change the `text` of the Button to be “Save”.

## [Step 3: Populate the DropDown](#step-3-populate-the-dropdown)

We want the choices in the DropDown to be the categories listed in our `categories` Data Table. To do this, we need to set the `items` property of the DropDown to a list of rows from the Data Table.

If we set the `items` property to be a list of 2-tuples, the first element of each tuple will be displayed in the DropDown. When a user selects an item in the DropDown, the second element of the tuple becomes the `selected_value` property of the DropDown.

We can set the DropDown so that the categories from the `categories` Data Table are displayed in the DropDown, but the associated row from the Data Table will be the `selected_value`.

```python
item_list = []
for row in app_tables.categories.search():
    item_list.append((row["name"], row))

self.drop_down_1.items = item_list
```

The above code can be refactored more succintly using a list comprehension:

```python
  self.drop_down_1.items = [(row["name"], row) for row in app_tables.categories.search()]
```

In order for the code above to run, we’ll need to make it so the `categories` Data Table can be [searched by the client](/docs/data-tables/data-security). By default, Data Tables are only accesible via server code.

## [Step 4: Set up the Button click event](#step-4-set-up-the-button-click-event)

Now we want the Button we added to the Form to do something. We’ll [set up a click event](/docs/client/components#events) that will take the `text` from the TextArea and the `selected_value` from the DropDown and add them to the `suggestions` Data Table. After adding the row, we’ll clear the TextArea:

```python
def self.button_1_click(self, **event_args):
  app_tables.suggestions.add_row(text=self.text_area_1.text, category=self.drop_down_1.selected_value)
  self.text_area_1.text=""
```

For this code to run, we’ll also need to make the `suggestions` Data Table editable by the client.

Run the app, add text to the TextArea and choose a category from the DropDown. Click the “Save” button then stop the app. Your `suggestions` Data Table should have a new row added.

## [(Optional) Step 5: Make the app more secure](#optional-step-5-make-the-app-more-secure)

By default, Anvil Data Tables are only searchable and editable by the server. This is because client code runs on the user’s browser, so users have access to that code. To build a secure app, you’ll want to run sensitive code in a [Server Module](/docs/server).

To make our example app more secure, we’ll need to change the permissions of the `suggestions` Data Table back to “No access”.

Next, we’ll need to create a Server Module and add to the `suggestions` Data Table from a server function instead of from the Button click event. Create the following function in the Sever Module:

```python
@anvil.server.callable
def add_suggestion(text, category):
  app_tables.suggestions.add_row(text=text, category=category)
```

Make sure the function has the `@anvil.server.callable` decorator so that we can call it from our client Form.

Go back to the code-view of `Form1`, and change the Button click function. It should now call the server function and pass in `self.text_area_1.text` and `self.drop_down_1.selected_value` as arguments:

```python
def self.button_1_click(self, **event_args):
  anvil.server.call("add_suggestion", self.text_area_1.text, self.drop_down_1.selected_value)
  self.text_area_1.text=""
```

Run the app again to test it out! It should work the same as before, but now users have no access to the `suggestions` Data Table.

Note: This guide includes screenshots of the **Classic Editor**. Since we created this guide, we've released the [new Anvil Editor](https://anvil.works/blog/announcing-new-editor), which is more powerful and easier to use.

All the code in this guide will work, but the Anvil Editor will look a little different to the screenshots you see here!
