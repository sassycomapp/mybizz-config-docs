# [Quickstart: Permissions](#quickstart-permissions)

### Give users different privileges

Anvil has a built-in user management system that makes login and permissions easy.

Follow this quickstart to check which user is logged in before running certain parts of your app (authorisation).

## [Create an app](#create-an-app)

Log in to Anvil and click ‘Blank App’. Choose the Material Design theme.

## [Add a login form](#add-a-login-form)

Add the Users Service to your app by clicking the blue plus button in the [Sidebar Menu](/docs/editor#sidebar-menu) and then selecting the Users service.

Write this code in the `__init__` method of Form1:

```python
    anvil.users.login_with_form()
```

Now run your app, sign up and verify your email (note: you’re only signing up to your own app here!).

(If you want more detail on this step, see the [User Login Quickstart](quickstart-login))

## [Check user permissions](#check-user-permissions)

Open the app browser in the [Sidebar Menu](/docs/editor#sidebar-menu). Then, click `+ Add Server Module`.

You will see a code editor with an orange background.

Write this function into the Server Module:

```python
@anvil.server.callable
def print_my_permissions():
  super_user = 'ryan@anvil.works'
  if anvil.users.get_user() is None:
    print("Nobody is logged in.")
  elif anvil.users.get_user()['email'] == super_user:
    print(f"{super_user} is allowed to see this.")
  else:
    print("This path is for minimum-access users.")
```

Change `super_user` to the email address you signed up to your app with.

## [Call your server function](#call-your-server-function)

Now go to the code for Form1 and add this line to the end of the `__init__` method:

```python
    anvil.server.call('print_my_permissions')
```

It calls your server function from the client.

## [Check that it works](#check-that-it-works)

Run your app and log in. You will see this in the App Console.

Sign up with a different email address (or just put some dummy data directly into the Users table). Log in with that email address and you will see `This path is for minimum-access users` in the App Console.

To see the `Nobody is logged in` message in the App Console, you have to reach the `if` statement in the `print_my_permissions` function with nobody logged in - comment out the `anvil.users.login_with_form()` line to achieve that.

## [User authorisation tips](#user-authorisation-tips)

That’s a quick introduction to user authorisation in Anvil. You will usually manage user permissions with `if` statements like the one in this quickstart.

### Guaranteeing Security

As a general rule, you should check user permissions in [Server Modules](/docs/server) rather than in client code. Any code running in a browser can be manipulated by the user - that goes for any web app, not just Anvil. Code in an Anvil Server Module is protected by industry-standard security best practice, so your permissions checks there are guaranteed to be honoured.

You can also run `anvil.users.get_user()` on your own machine(s) using the [Uplink](/docs/uplink), which of course can be just as secure as a Server Module (since you manage it, that’s up to you).

### User roles

Often, you want to assign a role to each user and vary access to your app depending on their role. This can be achieved by adding a Text column to the Users Data Table called something like `role`, then checking the value in this column when performing authorisation. The code from this example would be something like:

```python
    admin_role = "admin"
    if anvil.users.get_user() is None:
      print("Nobody is logged in.")
    elif anvil.users.get_user()['role'] == admin_role:
      print(f"Users with role '{admin_role}' are allowed to see this.")
    else:
      print("This path is for minimum-access users.")
```
