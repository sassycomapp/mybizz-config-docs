Find quick answers to common questions about building apps with Anvil.

If you can’t find an answer to your question here or anywhere else on our website, ask on our [Community Forum](https://anvil.works/forum).

## [Getting Started](#getting-started)

---

### What can I build with Anvil?

Anvil lets you build a wide range of full-stack web applications using only Python, with no JavaScript, HTML, or CSS required.

People use Anvil to build:

-   SaaS products
-   Minimum Viable Products (MVPs)
-   Machine learning applications
-   Web Portals
-   eCommerce and retail websites
-   Dashboards
-   Data Analytics tools
-   Progressive web apps
-   Mobile apps

For inspiration, check out our [case studies](../../case-studies) and [examples page](../../learn/examples). You can also browse the [Show and Tell forum](https://anvil.works/forum/c/show-and-tell/) to see what the community has been building or share your own projects.

---

### How do I start learning Anvil?

The best place to begin is our [Get Started guide](../get-started). From there, you can explore:

-   [Tutorials](../../learn/tutorials)
-   [Reference Docs](../overview)
-   [Community Forum](https://anvil.works/forum)

For community-created projects, demos, blogs, and tutorials, check out the [Awesome Anvil page](https://github.com/anvil-works/awesome-anvil).

---

### Do I need to know Python or web development before using Anvil?

No prior web development knowledge is needed. Anvil lets you build full-stack web apps with just Python, without needing to learn JavaScript, HTML, or CSS.

If you are new to Python or web development, our [Get Started guide](../get-started) has resources to get you up and running regardless of your background.

If you’d like to understand the basics of how web apps work, we also recommend MDN’s guide on [How the Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works).

## Building Apps with Anvil

---

### Which browsers does Anvil support?

Anvil apps support all major browsers currently receiving updates, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other Chromium-based browsers on both desktop and mobile.

The Anvil Editor supports up-to-date desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox.

---

### What’s the difference between server side and client side code?

In an Anvil app, code runs in two places:

-   **[Client](../client)**: runs in the user’s browser and handles the interface and user interactions.
-   **[Server](../server)**: runs in a secure cloud environment and handles business logic and sensitive operations.

Learn more about client-server architecture [here](../../articles/client-vs-server).

---

### Does Python really run in the browser? How does that work?

Yes – the Python you write in client-side Anvil Forms is compiled to JavaScript using the open-source framework [Skulpt](https://skulpt.org/).

For a deeper dive into how this works, check out our blog post on [Python in the browser](../../blog/python-in-the-browser-talk).

---

### Do Anvil apps work on mobile?

Yes, Anvil apps are responsive by default and work well on phones and tablets.

Anvil apps are also [Progressive Web Apps](../server/offline-apps#installing-anvil-apps), so they can be installed on Android, iPhone, or ChromeBook and work offline.

---

### Can I use JavaScript with Anvil?

You do not need to know JavaScript to use Anvil.

However, if you want to integrate with a low-level browser API or an existing JavaScript library, see our documentation on [Using JavaScript](../client/customisation/javascript).

---

### Can I use Python packages in my Anvil app?

Yes – you can install Python packages in your app’s **server code**. See [Adding packages](../server/custom-packages#adding-packages).

However, not all Python packages are available in **client code**. If you run an app that imports a package that isn’t available in the client, you may see an error like:

`NotImplementedImportError: logging is not yet implemented in Skulpt`

To learn more, see our documentation on [The Client-side Python Environment](../client/client-code/the-python-environment).

---

### Can I build APIs with Anvil?

Yes, Anvil lets you build HTTP APIs for your apps.

To get started, read our [HTTP APIs documentation](../external-resources/http-apis) or follow our [HTTP APIs tutorial](../../learn/tutorials/http-apis-in-python).

---

### Can I use Anvil with my own IDE or text editor?

Yes, you can use your IDE of choice with the [**Anvil CLI**](/docs/using-another-ide#using-anvil-from-a-local-ide).

Anvil’s IDE is web-based and includes many built-in features you’ll find in popular IDEs, but if you prefer working locally, the **Anvil CLI** lets you use your favourite editor and sync changes bidirectionally with the Anvil Editor. Check out the [CLI docs](/docs/using-another-ide#using-anvil-from-a-local-ide) to get started.

---

### Does Anvil support version control?

Yes, Anvil has built-in version control.

Every Anvil app is a Git repository, so you can:

-   [Push it to external Git repositories like GitHub](/docs/workflows/version-control/git).
-   [Clone it to your local machine](/docs/workflows/version-control/git/direct-checkout) and edit it there with any text editor or IDE.
-   Use a local IDE alongside the Anvil Editor with the live-syncing [Anvil CLI](../using-another-ide#using-anvil-from-a-local-ide).

---

## Hosting & Deployment

---

### Can I host my Anvil app on my own server?

Of course you can!

The Anvil framework is [open source](https://anvil.works/open-source), and you can self-host your apps anywhere using the [open-source Anvil App Server](https://github.com/anvil-works/anvil-runtime). See our [deployment guides](../how-to/app-server/cloud-deployment-guides) for hosting on popular cloud services.

---

### Where are Anvil’s servers located?

Anvil’s infrastructure is hosted in London (AWS eu-west-2).

If you require a specific location, the [Enterprise Plan](../plans-and-accounts/enterprise) gives you private Anvil infrastructure hosted wherever you want, in a public cloud, private cloud or on-site.

If you want to develop in the cloud but deploy on-site, you can also use our [open-source app server](https://github.com/anvil-works/anvil-runtime).

---

### What are Anvil’s server IPs?

If you’re on a [paid plan](../../pricing) and need a list of our egress IP addresses, please get in touch via [contact@anvil.works](mailto:contact@anvil.works).

We will reply with the current list of IPs and update you if they change.

---

### My custom domain shows an SSL certificate error. What do I do?

This is expected when setting up a custom domain. SSL provisioning can take up to **24-48 hours**. During this time, your browser may show a privacy error stating that the connection is not secure.

If the error persists after 48 hours, contact us at [support@anvil.works](mailto:support@anvil.works).

For more information, see our [Custom Domains documentation](../deployment/custom-domains).

---

### How do I fix the error message: `anvil.server.RuntimeUnavailableError: Server resources not available for 'python3-full'`?

Full Python 3 is now our legacy environment, and we recommend using the [Python 3.10 environment](../server/custom-packages) instead, which lets you install any package you like.

This error can be caused by a delay in activating a paid plan or 7-day trial for the legacy Full Python environment.

![Server code dropdown in the Anvil Editor](../server/img/custom-packages/python-310.png)

Switch to Python 3.10 in the Editor for instant activation.

---

## Security & Privacy

---

### Who owns my app?

You own your app and all of its content, even if you cancel your Anvil account.

For full details, see our [Terms of Service](../../terms-of-service).

---

### Does Anvil have a bug bounty program?

We take security very seriously, but we do not currently run a bug bounty program.

If you’ve found a security issue, report it to [security@anvil.works](mailto:security@anvil.works).

---

## Plans, Support & Community

---

### How many apps can I build?

You can build an unlimited number of apps with your Anvil account, even on the Free Plan.

---

### Where can I get a quote for an Enterprise plan?

For a quote on our [Enterprise Plan](../plans-and-accounts/enterprise), contact us at [sales@anvil.works](mailto:sales@anvil.works).

---

### How do I sign up for Production?

Moving your account to Production involves transferring your data to your new isolated database. Contact us at [sales@anvil.works](mailto:sales@anvil.works) to activate your new plan and schedule the changeover.

---

### Can I use Anvil for teaching or education?

Yes – Anvil is free for classroom use and is widely used by lecturers and students to teach and learn Python and web development.
