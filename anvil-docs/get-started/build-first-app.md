# [Build a Hello World app](#build-a-hello-world-app)

It’s simple to get started building full-stack web apps in Anvil, but even easier if you know the basics! Follow along to dive right in and learn how to build a Hello World app.

We’ll build a user interface with a text input and a button. When visitors come to our app, they’ll type in their name and click the button to see a “hello” message. We’ll also store the names of our app visitors in a built-in database. Finally, we’ll publish our app to the web.

You will learn how to:

1.  Build a UI using drag and drop
2.  Make the UI interactive
3.  Write secure server code
4.  Store data in a built-in database
5.  Deploy your app

This guide assumes you have some familiarity coding with [Python](https://www.python.org/). If you are new to Python, check out some of our [recommended resources](/docs/get-started/help#python) before you get started with Anvil.

## [Step 0: Create an Anvil app](#step-0-create-an-anvil-app)

To create our Hello World app, we first need to create an Anvil app, Navigate to [anvil.works/build](https://anvil.works/build) and click “Create a new app”. From the modal menu that pops up, choose “New M3”.

If you don’t see the New M3 theme as an option, click “Advanced” to show all available themes.

If you are opening Anvil for the first time, you may be prompted to complete a challenge to unlock the full Anvil Editor. You’ll need to complete the challenge before you can build this Hello World app.

You can now choose from a variety of layouts for your app. We are just making a simple Hello World app, so go ahead and choose “Blank Panel”. This will give us a blank page to start with no added UI elements.

## [Step 1: Build a UI](#step-1-build-a-ui)

Let’s now build the User Interface. For our app, we want a text input (so users can input their name), a button (for users to click on) and a component to display the “hello” message.

### 1.1 Drag and drop components

From the panel on the right-hand side of the Editor, drag and drop a [Card component](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/components#card) onto the page. We call this panel [the Toolbox](/docs/editor/form-editor#toolbox). It holds all the UI components available for our app. Inside the Card, drag and drop a [TextBox component](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/components#textbox).

### 1.2 Change the look and feel

This TextBox has a number of different [properties](/docs/client/component-properties) that allow you to control its look and feel. When you select a component, you’ll be able to find some common properties in the floating [Object Palette](/docs/editor/form-editor#object-palette).

Let’s give our TextBox some placeholder text by setting its `placeholder` property. We can find all of a component’s properties on the right in the [Properties Panel](/docs/editor/form-editor#properties-panel). In the Properties Panel under “Key Properties”, set the `placeholder` property to be “Enter your name…”. You can also set any other properties you want here.

### 1.3 Finish the UI

Next, drag a [Button](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/components#button) onto the Card. In the Object Palette, click the icon to center the Button on the page, then click the icon to change the text of the Button to “Say Hello”.

Finally, we need a component that will display our “hello” message. Drag and drop a [Heading](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/components#heading) component under the Card. You can center align the Heading or adjust any other properties that you want.

### 1.4 Test the app

Let’s now test out our app so far. In the top right of the Editor, click the green Run button to run the app in a [Development Environment](/docs/deployment/environments#development-environments). Here, we can test out how users will interact with our app. We have a finished UI but clicking on the “Say Hello” button doesn’t do anything. In the next step, we’ll fix that by adding interactivity to our app.

## [Step 2: Add interactivity](#step-2-add-interactivity)

### 2.1 The `Form` class

The page to which we’ve added our components is called a [Form](/docs/ui/forms). Each Form is represented by a Python class. If you click on the [“Code” tab](/docs/editor/form-editor#code-view) above the Form Editor, you can see the `Form` class that defines our page. Here we can write Python code to make our app interactive.

All of the components that we’ve added to our UI are also instances of Python classes. This means we can access them from a variable name and interact with them in code.

By default, the `TextBox` we added to our `Form` has the variable name `text_box_1`. It’s good practice to rename components to indicate their purpose, so let’s do that now. Switch back to the [“Design” view](/docs/editor/form-editor#design-view) for the Form and click on the TextBox. From the Object Palette, rename the component `name_box`.

Next, change the name of the Button to be `say_hello_button` and the name of the Heading to be `name_display`.

### 2.2 Create a `click` event

Let’s now write some Python code that runs when the user clicks the Button.

When a users interacts with an interactive component, an [event](/docs/client/events) is fired. For example, when a user clicks a Button, a `click` event is fired. We can write a function, called an event handler, that will run when the event is fired.

Select the Button and from the Object Palette, click `on click event`.

This will automatically open up the Code view and set up an event handler called `say_hello_button_click`. This method will be decorated with `@handle`, which is how Anvil knows to call this method when this event is raised on this component, i.e. when the button is clicked. You can also set up event handlers [entirely in code](/docs/client/events#setting-event-handlers-in-code).

Any code written in this method will run when the `click` event is fired, i.e when the Button is clicked. Inside the method, add the following code:

```python
@handle("say_hello_button", "click")
def say_hello_button_click(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the component is clicked."""
    # add this code:
    name = self.name_box.text
    print(name)
    self.name_display.text = f"Hello, {name}!"
```

The above code sets the `text` property of the Heading component (which we named `name_display`) to be “Hello” plus the name that the user enters into the TextBox (its `text` property). We are also printing the name inputted into `name_display` so we can see what output from our app looks like.

### 2.3 Test the app

Let’s now test out our app again. This time, when we click the Button, something should happen.

Click the green Run button again, type a name into the TextBox and click the “Say Hello” button. This time, a message should appear below the Button to say “hello”!

The output from the print statement will appear below in the [App Console](/docs/editor#app-console).

## [Step 3: Write server code](#step-3-write-server-code)

So far, all of the code in our app runs in the user’s browser. We call this type of code client code. We could finish our app here, but usually in a web application, we’ll also want to write code that runs on a secure server. This might be code that does heavy data processing, deals with sensitive data or uses a third-party Python package.

Because client code runs in the browser and users have control over their browsers, client code is not secure. Any code that deals with sensitive data or needs to excute exactly as written should be run in a Server Module.

Want to learn more about client and server code? [Read our handy guide](/articles/client-vs-server).

### 3.1 Add a Server Module

Let’s expand our app so that it runs some code on the server. To do this, we need to add a [Server Module](/docs/server) to our app. In the [App Browser](/docs/editor#the-app-browser) on the left, click the “ Add Server Module” button under “Server Code”.

Server Modules are regular Python environments where we can install packages and run arbitrary Python code. However, unlike a regular Python script, Server Modules do not run top to bottom. Instead, we write functions here that we can call from client code or from other server functions.

### 3.2 Write a server function

For now, let’s add a server function to our Server Module that just prints out a “hello” message. In the Server Module, add the following function:

```python
@anvil.server.callable
def say_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

Notice the decorator above the function. [The `anvil.server.callable` decorator](/docs/server#calling-server-functions-from-client-code) is what allows us to call this function from our Form code. Without it, our client-side code won’t find any function called `say_hello`.

### 3.3 Call the server function from client code

Let’s now go back to our Form code. Click on `Form1` in the App Browser and switch to the code tab. In the `say_hello_button_click` method, add a call to the server function we just wrote. You can call server functions from client code using `anvil.server.call()`. You just need to pass in the name of the function and any arguments it takes:

```python
@handle("say_hello_button", "click")
def say_hello_button_click(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the component is clicked."""
    name = self.name_box.text
    self.name_display.text = f"Hello, {name}!"
    print(name)
    # add this line:
    anvil.server.call("say_hello", name)
```

### 3.4 Test the app

Once again, let’s test our app. Click the green Run button, add a name to the TextBox and click “Say Hello”. There should now be additional output that appears in the App Console. Output that comes from the client has a blue line next to it, whereas output from the server has an orange line next to it.

The first time you make a server call, the Python server runtime will start and log a message to the console. Because the runtime is starting up, you may notice your app is slightly slower the first time you run it.

We now have a working backend that communicates with our frontend. In the next step, we’ll set up a database for our app and modify our existing server function to store entries in the database.

## [Step 4: Store app visitors in a database](#step-4-store-app-visitors-in-a-database)

Let’s extend our app further and store the names of people visiting our app in a database. Luckily, Anvil has a built-in database, called Data Tables, that makes it easy to store, read and edit data.

You don’t have to use Anvil’s built-in database for your apps. Instead, you can [connect to an external database](/docs/data-tables/external-database) and access your data from a Server Module.

### 4.1 Add a Data Table

In the [Sidebar Menu](/docs/editor#sidebar-menu) on the left, click on the Data icon then click the “ Add New Table” button. This will add a new Data Table to your app. Rename it to `visitors`.

### 4.2 Set up the Data Table schema

We now need to set up the schema for our Data Table. We are going to want two columns, one to store the name of our app visitors and one to store the time that they visited the app.

Add a new column to the Data Table. In the modal that appears, name the column “name” and choose “Text” as the type. Now add a Date and Time column to the Data Table called “visited”.

### 4.3 Add rows to the Data Table

Now that we have our Data Table set up, we can modify our server function to add a row to the Data Table every time a user hits the “Say Hello” button.

We can interact with our app’s Data Tables using the [`app_tables` API](/docs/data-tables/data-tables-in-code). Navigate back to the Server Module and update the function we wrote in the previous step:

```python
@anvil.server.callable
def say_hello(name):
    # add this line:
    app_tables.visitors.add_row(name=name, visited=datetime.now())
```

The function now uses `add_row()` to add a row to the `vistors` Data Table. Because we are using the [`datetime` libary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) to populate our `visited` column, we also need to import `datetime` at the top of our Server Module:

```python
# add this import statement:
from datetime import datetime

@anvil.server.callable
def say_hello(name):
    app_tables.visitors.add_row(name=name, visited=datetime.now())
```

### 4.4 Test the app

We’re already calling the `say_hello` server function from our Form code, so all we need to do now is run the app and test it out.

Add a name to the TextBox and click the button. Do this a few times with different names. Stop the app and check the Data Table. You should see a few entries added to the Data Table. (If nothing is showing up, you may need to hit the “Refresh” button at the top of the Data Table Editor.)

## [Step 5: Publish the app](#step-5-publish-the-app)

Now that we are finished with our app, let’s publish it to the web so we can share it with others!

In the top right corner of the Editor, click the Publish button, then click “ Publish this app”. This will automatically create a public URL for our app. Click on the URL to naviage to your published app.

Your Hello World app is now running live on the web! Add a name to the TextBox and click the button. Check your database to see the new row added.

## [What’s next?](#whats-next)

### Extend the app

Up for a challenge? Try expanding the app to make it more robust and fully featured. Here are some suggestions of ways to upgrade your app:

**Validate the TextBox before submiting**: Right now, the app will still call the server function even if no name has been added to the TextBox. Try adding validation to check that the TextBox has text before calling the server function. **Tip**: The TextBox has an [`error` property](https://anvil.works/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/components#form-input) that you can use to indicate an error to the user.

**Send an email when a user clicks the button**: Try adding Anvil’s built-in [email service](/docs/email) to send yourself an email whenever the “Say Hello” button is clicked. **Hint**: You’ll need to do this from the server function.

**Create a survey**: Instead of just storing the names of visitors, expand your UI to build a survey. Try adding [Checkboxes](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/components#checkbox), [RadioButtons](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/components#radiobutton) and [DropdownMenus](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/components#dropdownmenu) to ask a variety of questions, then store the responses in the Data Table.
