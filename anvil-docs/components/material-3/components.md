# [Material 3 Components](#material-3-components)

Similarly to [Standard Anvil components](/docs/components/standard-components), you can use Material 3 components in two ways: by dragging them from the Toolbox then dropping them onto a [Form](/docs/ui/forms) or by constructing them in [client code](/docs/client).

If you want to construct a Material 3 component from client code, you’ll first need to import the component from the Material 3 theme. All Material 3 components can be imported from `m3.components`. For example, to add a Material 3 Button to your app, you would first need to add the following import statement:

```python
import m3.components as m3
```

You can then use this Button in client code:

```python
m3_button = m3.Button(text="submit")
```

However, the easiest way to use components is by dragging and dropping them from the Toolbox.

Every component you add will have a Python name that will allow you to interact with the component in client code:

```python
self.button_1.text = "submitted"
```

The following is a list of all the components in the Material 3 theme.

## [Typography](#typography)

Typography components are used for displaying text. There are three typography components in the Anvil Material 3 theme:

### Text

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Text_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Text_events)

Text components are suitable for the text included in your app’s content. This is usually long passages of text or descriptive labels that accompany other components, like a Switch or a TextBox.

There are two styles of Text (`body` and `label`), which can be set to three different type scales (`small`, `medium` and `large`). As with the Text component, they can be set from the Properties Panel and from code.

```python
m3_text = m3.Text(text="Enter your name:", style="label", scale="medium")
```

Find a complete list of the Text component’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#Text).

### Heading

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Heading_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Heading_events)

Heading are useful for titles and high-emphasis text.

Headings can be set to three different styles (`display`, `headline` and `title`). Like Text components, they can be set to three different type scales. This can be done from code and from the Properties Panel.

```python
m3_heading = m3.Heading(text="Expense Dashboard", style="headline", scale="large")
```

Find a complete list of the Heading’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#Heading).

### Link

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Link_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Link_events)

Links are typography components that can be clicked to trigger actions. They are useful for navigating to different parts of your app or to other websites entirely, for example.

When the component is clicked, it will open the target URL defined through its `url` property.

```python
self.m3_link = m3.Link(text="Visit the Anvil docs", url="https://anvil.works/docs")
```

A Link’s `url` can also be set to a [Media object](/docs/working-with-files/media). In this case, clicking the Lin will download the Media object.

```python
media = anvil.BlobMedia('text/plain', b'Hello, world!', name='hello.txt')
self.m3_link = m3.Link(text="Download text document", url=media)
```

Instead of using the `url` property, Links also have a `click` event that can run when the component is clicked.

```python
def m3_link_click(self, **event_args):
  """This method is called when the link is clicked"""
  form1 = Form1()
  open_form(form1)
```

Find a complete list of the Link’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#Link).

## [Buttons](#buttons)

Buttons are for performing actions.

### Button

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Button_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Button_events)

A Button is a clickable component used for prompting actions. Buttons have five different pre-defined appearances that you can set from the Properties Panel or in code. You can also add icons to your Buttons or disable them.

```python
self.m3_button = m3.Button(text="Submit", appearance="filled")
```

In order for the Button to trigger an action when clicked, you’ll need to [set a `click` event](/docs/client/events). The easiest way to do so is by clicking `on click event` in the Object Palette. You can then write code that will run when a user clicks the button.

```python
  def m3_button_click(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the component is clicked."""
    anvil.server.call('submit_info')
    m3_button.text = "Submitted"
```

Find a complete list of the Button’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#Button).

### IconButton

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#IconButton_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#IconButton_events)

IconButtons are useful for performing actions that are understandable with just an icon. For example, logging out, favouriting a post or deleting a message can all be conveyed with an icon.

IconButtons have four different pre-set appearance options and by default, have a star icon.

```python
self.m3_icon_button = m3.IconButton(icon="logout" appearance="outlined")
```

Like Buttons, IconButtons have a `click` event that you can set up so that some code will run when the IconButton is clicked:

```python
  def m3_icon_button_click(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the component is clicked."""
    anvil.users.logout()
```

Find a complete list of the IconButton’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#IconButton).

### ToggleIconButton

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#ToggleIconButton_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#ToggleIconButton_events)

ToggleIconButtons are the same as IconButtons except that they have a `selected` state. ToggleIconButtons are used to select or deselect a single choice, for example to favourite or un-favourite a post.

ToggleIconButtons have the same appearance options as IconButtons, just with an added `selected` state.

```python
self.m3_toggle_icon_button = m3.ToggleIconButton(icon="favorite" appearance="filled")
```

Like Buttons and IconButtons, ToggleIconButtons have a `click` event that you can set up to run code when the component is clicked.

Find a complete list of the ToggleIconButton’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#ToggleIconButton).

## [Display](#display)

Display components are designed to help display content on the page.

### Card

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Card_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Card_events)

Cards are used to display and group related components together.

Cards have three predefined appearance options, `elevated`, `filled`, and `outlined`, that can be set from the Properties Panel or in code. Cards also have an `orientation` property that can be set to `row` or `column`. Setting the `orientation` changes the stacking direction of the components within the Card.

When you drag and drop a Card from the Toolbox, it will have a CardContentContainer component nested inside. A CardContentContainer is a simple container with a `margin` property, which defaults to 16px but can be adjusted. The CardContentContainer can always be deleted or re-added from the Toolbox.

You can add components to the CardContentContainer or outside of the CardContentContainer (but still within the Card). This is especially useful for adding images to a Card. Below are two Cards, both with [Image](/docs/ui/components/basic#image) components added outside of the CardContentContainer. Inside the CardContentContainer, there is a [Heading](#heading) component and a [Text](#text) component. The `display_mode` of the Images is set to `zoom_to_fill`. Because the Images are not inside the CardContentContainer, they have no margin and extend to the edge of the Card.

### InteractiveCard

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#InteractiveCard_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#InteractiveCard_events)

InteractiveCards are like standard [Cards](#card) but clickable. They have the same appearance options as Cards: `elevated`, `filled` and `outlined`.

You can set up a `click` event for InteractiveCards from the Properties Panel or in code. Because InteractiveCards have a `click` event, they also have an `enabled` property that can be set to `False` to disable user interaction.

```python
  def m3_interactive_card_click(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the component is clicked."""
    alert("You just clicked an InteractiveCard")
    self.m3_interactive_card.enabled = False
```

Find a complete list of the InteractiveCard’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#InteractiveCard).

### Avatar

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Avatar_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Avatar_events)

An Avatar represents a user and can display an image, initials or a fallback icon.

Avatar components have an `image` property that can be used to display a user profile image. Avatars also have a `user_name` property, which you can use to associate the user’s name with the Avatar. If no `image` property is set but a `user_name` is set, the Avatar will display the user’s initials. If no `image` or `user_name` is set, the Avatar will instead display the `fallback_icon`. The `fallback_icon` defaults to the “person” [Material Icon](https://fonts.google.com/icons), but this can be set to a different icon.

Avatars have three `appearance` options: `filled`, `tonal` and `outlined`.

### Divider

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Divider_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Divider_events)

Dividers are components used for visually grouping or separating components.

There are two types of Divider:

-   `full-width`, meant for separating large sections from one another.
-   `inset`, meant for indicating separation within a section. These are useful for separating elements in a list, for example.

```python
m3_divider = m3.Divider(type="inset")
```

Find a complete list of the Heading’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#Divider).

## [Navigation](#navigation)

Navigation components are used to navigate between parts of your app.

### NavigationLink

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#NavigationLink_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#NavigationLink_events)

NavigationLinks are components designed to work with the Material 3 Layouts to make it easy to navigate between Forms. NavigationLinks are meant to only be placed inside the [Navigation Rail](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/layouts#navigation-rail-layout) or [Navigation Drawer](/docs/ui/app-themes/material-3/layouts#navigation-drawer-layout) sections of the Layouts. They have different styling depending on which one they’re placed into.

NavigationLinks have a `navigate_to` property that can be set to any Form in your app. This is the Form that will be opened when the NavigationLink is clicked.

```python
self.m3_navlink = m3.NavigationLink(text="Home", icon="home", navigate_to=Home())
```

Alternatively, you can define your own `click` event handler.

```python
def m3_navlink_click(self, **event_args):
    open_form(Home())
```

Note that Forms are not available to other Forms unless you explicitly import them. Each Form has its own module, which has the same name as the Form, so to import Form2 from inside Form1, you use `from ..Form2 import Form2`.

[Learn about importing Forms, Modules and Packages in Anvil](/docs/app-architecture/how-to-import-things)

Material 3 NavigationLinks can have badges to visually indicate notifications or item counts.

```python
self.m3_navlink.badge = True
self.m3_navlink.badge_count = 4
```

Find a complete list of the NavigationRail’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#NavigationLink).

## [Menus](#menus)

Menus hold other components as a list of options. [MenuItem](#menuitem) components are designed to populate Menus.

### ButtonMenu

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#ButtonMenu_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#ButtonMenu_events)

A ButtonMenu component is a [Button](#button) that opens a floating menu when clicked. The floating menu is designed to contain other components, namely [MenuItems](#menuitem).

You can click on the ButtonMenu in the Anvil Editor to open the floating menu, then drag and drop components inside the menu. You can also populate the menu in code using the `menu_items` property, which expects a list of components.

```python
m3_button_menu = m3.ButtonMenu()

m3_menu_item_1 = m3.MenuItem(text="Undo", leading_icon="undo")
m3_menu_item_2 = m3.MenuItem(text="Redo", leading_icon="redo")

m3_button_menu.menu_items = [m3_menu_item_1, m3_menu_item_2]
```

Find a complete list of the ButtonMenu’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#ButtonMenu).

### MenuItem

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#MenuItem_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#MenuItem_events)

MenuItem components are built to be nested inside a [ButtonMenu](#buttonmenu)’s floating menu.

Clicking on the ButtonMenu in the Anvil Editor will open the floating menu, where you can then drag and drop MenuItems inside. You can also instantiate MenuItems in code, then populate the ButtonMenu using its `menu_items` property.

```python
m3_menu_item = m3.MenuItem(text="Settings", leading_icon="settings")
```

A MenuItem can optionally have a leading icon, a trailing icon and/or trailing text. If you want to have multiple MenuItems in the same menu, but don’t want all of them to contain leading icons, you can set the `add_icon_space` property to be `True`. The `add_icon_space` property will add a space to MenuItems that don’t have a leading icon set so that the text of all the MenuItems will still line up.

Here is the code for the above ButtonMenu:

```python
m3_menu_item_1 = m3.MenuItem(text="No icons")
m3_menu_item_2 = m3.MenuItem(text="Both icons", leading_icon="visibility", trailing_icon="check")
m3_menu_item_3 = m3.MenuItem(text="Added icon space", add_icon_space=True)
m3_menu_item_4 = m3.MenuItem(text="Trailing text, icon", leading_icon="undo", trailing_text="Ctrl+Z")

menu_items = [m3_menu_item_1, m3_menu_item_2, m3_menu_item_3, m3_menu_item_4]

m3_button_menu = m3.ButtonMenu(text="Click to see MenuItems", menu_items=menu_items)
```

MenuItems also have a `click` event that can be set up so that code will run when the component is clicked:

```python
def m3_menu_item_click(self, **event_args):
  """This method is called when the component is clicked"""
  open_form("SettingsPage")
```

Find a complete list of the MenuItems’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#MenuItem).

### IconButtonMenu

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#IconButtonMenu_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#IconButtonMenu_events)

An IconButtonMenu is similar to a [ButtonMenu](#buttonmenu), but uses an [IconButton](#iconbutton) to open the floating menu. The floating menu is designed to contain other components, namely [MenuItems](#menuitem).

Like ButtonMenus, IconButtonMenus have a `menu_items` property that can be used to populate the menu via code. See the [ButtonMenu](#buttonmenu) documentation for more information.

### AvatarMenu

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#AvatarMenu_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#AvatarMenu_events)

AvatarMenu components are similar a [ButtonMenus](#buttonmenu) and [IconButtons](#iconbutton). Clicking on an AvatarMenu opens a floating menu, which is designed to contain other components, namely [MenuItems](#menuitem).

Just like the [Avatar](#avatar) component, the AvatarMenu has `image`, `user_name` and `fallback_icon` properties.

AvatarMenus also have a `menu_items` property that can be used to populate the menu via code. See the [ButtonMenu](#buttonmenu) documentation for more information.

## [Form Input](#form-input)

Form Inputs are interactive components used to get data from the user.

Some Form Input components allow error states. When a component’s `error` property is set to `True`, their appearance will change to convey their state.

```python
m3_checkbox = m3.Checkbox(text="I accept the terms an conditions*", error="True")
```

### Checkbox

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Checkbox_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Checkbox_events)

A Checkbox allows the user to input a boolean value - checked or unchecked.

```python
m3_checkbox = m3.Checkbox(text="Remember my details", checked=False)
```

Checkbox components also support a third state, indeterminate. In a group of nested Checkboxes, this state is used for the parent Checkbox, to indicate that at least one of the children is checked.

You can only set a Checkbox to indeterminate from code or with a data binding. You will need to set `allow_indeterminate` to `True` and `checked` to `None`.

```python
m3_checkbox = m3.Checkbox(text="Indeterminate checkbox", allow_indeterminate=True, checked=None)
```

Find a complete list of the Checkbox’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#Checkbox).

### RadioButton and RadioGroupPanel

RadioButtons allow users to select a single option from a list.

```python
m3_radio_button = m3.RadioButton(text="Option 1", selected=True, value="Option 1")
```

When RadioButtons are placed inside a RadioGroupPanel, they are grouped together, allowing users to select only one option from that group. If a RadioButton is added directly to the page without a RadioGroupPanel, it is automatically assigned to a global group.

RadioGroupPanels have a `buttons` property, through which you can access a list of all the RadioButtons contained within it.

```python
for b in m3_radio_group_panel.buttons:
  print(b.value)
```

Material 3 RadioButtons have a `select` event that can be set up so that code will run when the component is selected (this event will not fire when the component gets de-selected):

```python
  def option_1_select(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the component is selected."""
    print("Option 1 has been selected")
```

RadioGroupPanel components also have a `change` event which is triggered whenever one of the RadioButtons in the group changes.

```python
  def m3_radio_group_panel_change(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the component is selected."""
    print("The group has changed")
```

You can access the currently selected RadioButton’s `value` in a group through the RadioGroupPanel’s `selected_value` property. Similarly, you can use the `selected_button` property to access the name of the currently selected RadioButton.

```python
def m3_radio_group_panel_change(self, **event_args):
    print(m3_radio_group_panel.selected_value)
    print(m3_radio_group_panel.selected_button)
```

### TextBox

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#TextBox_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#TextBox_events)

TextBox components allow users to input text into your app and are useful for building forms. They have two appearance options: filled and outlined.

```python
self.m3_text_field = m3.TextBox(appearance="outlined")
```

TextBoxes accept input text which can be set and accessed from the component’s `text` property.

A common way to use a TextBox is to set up a [`pressed_enter` event handler](/docs/api/m3#TextBox_events) that runs code after a user types in some text and presses enter. For example, the following code adds the `text` to a Data Table after the user presses enter:

```python
  def m3_text_field_pressed_enter(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the user presses enter in this component."""
    entered_text = self.m3_text_field.text
    #first check if text has been entered
    if entered_text:
      #if true, call a server function to add the text to the data table
      anvil.server.call('add_to_data_table', entered_text)
```

TextBoxes also have a number of optional properties that can be set to make your form inputs more robust. Below is a list of some of the most useful properties:

-   `label_text`: Adds text to label what the TextBox is for (e.g. Email address). The `label_text` acts as a placeholder (unless `placeholder` is set) and moves to the top of the TextBox when a user inputs text to the TextBox. If there is placeholder text, the label will always be at the top of the TextBox.
-   `placeholder`: Adds placeholder text to the TextBox that is only present when the TextBox is empty.
-   `character_limit`: Sets a maximum number of characters that can be entered into the TextBox. If present, the character limit will be displayed in small text below the component.
-   `supporting_text`: Adds small text underneath the TextBox to convey additional information (e.g. \*required).
-   `leading_icon`: Adds a leading icon to the TextBox.
-   `trailing_icon`: Adds a trailing icon to the TextBox. TextBoxes can also have a `trailing_icon_click` event that will run when this icon is clicked. For example, you could add a `close` icon as the trailing icon that when clicked, clears the `text` in the TextBox.

Find a complete list of the TextBox’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#TextBox).

### TextArea

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#TextArea_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#TextArea_events)

TextAreas are similar to TextBoxes but they are expandable and allow the user to input more text. They have two appearance options: filled and outlined.

```python
self.m3_text_area = m3.TextArea(appearance="outlined")
```

TextAreas also have a number of optional properties that can be set to make your form inputs more robust. Below is a list of some of the most useful properties:

-   `label_text`: Adds text to label what the TextArea is for (e.g. Feedback). The `label_text` acts as a placeholder (unless `placeholder` is set) and moves to the top of the TextArea when a user inputs text to the TextArea. If there is placeholder text, the label will always be at the top of the TextArea.
-   `placeholder`: Adds placeholder text to the TextArea that is only there when the TextArea is empty.
-   `character_limit`: Sets a maximum number of characters that can be entered into the TextArea. If present, the character limit will be displayed in small text below the component.
-   `supporting_text`: Adds small text underneath the TextArea to convey additional information, for example, that inputing text into the component is required.

Find a complete list of the TextArea’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#TextArea).

### DropdownMenu

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#DropdownMenu_properties) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#DropdownMenu_events)

A DropdownMenu component allows users to choose one item from a menu of options. The chosen option is then displayed on the component. The DropdownMenu in Material 3 functions like the standard [Anvil DropDown component](/docs/ui/components/basic#dropdown).

DropdownMenu components have two appearance options: filled and outlined:

```python
self.m3_dropdown_menu = m3.DropdownMenu(
  items=["Pink", "Blue", "Green", "Purple"],
  placeholder="What's your favourite color?")
```

A DropdownMenu has an `items` property that populates the menu. You can set the `items` property from the Properties Panel or in code. If you set `items` property from the Properties Panel, each item should be on a separate line.

In code, the `items` property can be set to a list of strings (e.g. \[“Yes”, “No”\]) or to a list of 2-tuples (e.g. \[(“Yes”, True), (“No”, False)\]). You can access the item selected by the user from the `selected_value` property.

If you set the `items` property to be a list of 2-tuples, then the first element in the tuple is what gets displayed in the menu. When an item is selected, the second element in the tuple becomes the `selected_value` property. This is particularly useful if you want choose from a list of Data Table rows:

```python
self.m3_dropdown.items = [(row["name"], row) for row in app_tables.people.search()]
```

DropdownMenus have a number of other useful properties:

-   `label_text`: Adds text to inform of what the DropdownMenu is for (e.g. Country of residence). The `label_text` acts as a placeholder (unless `placeholder` is set) and moves to the top of the component when a user selects a value from the menu. If there is placeholder text, the label will always be at the top of the component.
-   `placeholder`: Adds placeholder text to the DropdownMenu that is only there when there is no `selected_value`.
-   `allow_none`: If `True`, then the user will be able to select an item from the menu that sets the `selected_value` to `None`. If `placeholder` is set, then the placeholder text will be added to the menu to represent the `None` item. Otherwise, the `None` item will be empty.
-   `supporting_text`: Adds small text underneath the DropdownMenu to convey additional information, for example, that selecting a value is required.
-   `leading_icon`: Adds a leading icon to the DrodownMenu.

Find a complete list of the DropdownMenu’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#DropdownMenu).

### Switch

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Switch_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Switch_events)

A Switch allows users to toggle a boolean value. They’re useful for controlling standalone, binary options, like turning a setting on or off.

```python
m3_switch = m3.Switch(selected=True)
```

Switch components have a `change` event that triggers whenever the switch is toggled on or off.

```python
  def m3_switch_change(self, **event_args):
      """This method is called when the value of the component is changed"""
      self.text_area_1.visible = self.switch_1.selected
```

Find a complete list of the Switch’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#Switch).

### FileLoader

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#FileLoader_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#FileLoader_events)

FileLoaders are used to load files from your device into your app. Similarly to Buttons, they have five pre-defined appearance options that you can set from the Properties Panel and from code.

```python
self.m3_fileloader = m3.FileLoader(text="Submit", appearance="filled")
```

You can access the currently selected file in a FileLoader through the `file` property. If the FileLoader allows loading multiple files, the `files` property will return a list of all the selected files. Any file loaded using a FileLoader will be a [Media object](/docs/working-with-files/media).

```python
self.my_image.source = self.m3_fileloader.file
```

FileLoader files are loaded into the user’s browser. You can pass them into a server function to get them into a [Server Module](/docs/server) (since they’re Media objects, they will be streamed).

```python
anvil.server.call('image_classifier', self.m3_fileloader.file)
```

FileLoaders have a `change` event that is raised when a user selects one or multiple files. Its `file` argument is a Media object containing the chosen file.

```python
def m3_fileloader_change(self, file, **event_args):
    self.my_image.source = file
```

To reset the FileLoader after file uploading, call its `clear()` method.

```python
self.m3_fileloader.clear()
```

Find a complete list of the FileLoader’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#FileLoader).

### Slider

[Properties](/docs/api/m3#Slider_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/m3#Slider_events)

With a Slider, users can select a value from a range.

In order for the Slider component to work, a few key properties must be set:

-   `max`: The maximum value of the Slider
-   `min`: The minimum value of the Slider
-   `step`: The stepping interval of the Slider
-   `value`: The current value of the Slider

When you add a Slider to your app, it is initialised with a `max` of 10, a `min` of 0, a `step` of 1 and a `value` of 5.

If the `show_label` property is set to `True`, then a label with the current value of the Slider will be visible when the user drags the Slider thumb. Setting `show_markers` to `True` adds discrete markers to the track of the Slider.

Sliders have a `change` event that triggers whenever the value of the Slider changes. For example, if a Slider has the following `change` event handler set up, then the `text` of the Text component would be updated every time the user releases the slider thumb and the value has changed:

```python
  def slider_1_change(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the value of the component is changed"""
    self.text_1.text = self.slider_1.value
```

Find a complete list of the Slider’s properties and events in the [API documentation](/docs/api/m3#Slider).

## [Feedback](#feedback)

Use feedback components to show the status of a process.

### LinearProgressIndicator

LinearProgressIndicators are used to show the live status of a process. LinearProgressIndicators have a `type` property that can be set to `determinate` or `indeterminate`. If `determinate`, the progress is set using the component’s `progress` property. The `progress` property accepts a number that is then converted to a percentage to determine the progress. If the `type` is `indeterminate`, the LinearProgressIndicator will play an animation on a loop.

```python
m3_linearprogressindicator_indeterminate = m3.LinearProgressIndicator(type="indeterminate")
m3_linearprogressindicator_determinate = m3.LinearProgressIndicator(type="determinate", progress="40")
```

### CircularProgressIndicator

Like LinearProgressIndicators, CircularProgressIndicators are used to show the live status of a process. CircularProgressIndicators have a `type` property that can be set to `determinate` or `indeterminate`. If `determinate`, the progress is set using the component’s `progress` property. The `progress` property accepts a number that is then converted to a percentage to determine the progress. If the `type` is `indeterminate`, the CircularProgressIndicator will play an animation on a loop.

```python
m3_circularprogressindicator_indeterminate = m3.CircularProgressIndicator(type="indeterminate")
m3_circularprogressindicator_determinate = m3.CircularProgressIndicator(type="determinate", progress="40")
```
