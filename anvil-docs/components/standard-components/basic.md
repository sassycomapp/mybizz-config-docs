# [Basic Components](#basic-components)

This is a list of the basic components available in Anvil.

The **properties** and **events** for each component are listed in the [API Reference](/docs/api/anvil).

You can also find out about a component’s properties and events by creating one in the Anvil Editor and examining it in the Properties Panel. Hover your mouse over the name of each property or event for more information.

### Scrolling a component into view

Anvil provides a `scroll_into_view()` method on each component, which scrolls the screen to bring that component into view:

```python
  def form_show(self, **event_args):
    # Scroll button1 into view
    self.button_1.scroll_into_view()
```

To scroll a component into view, the component must already be rendered to the page. So if you want to scroll to a specific component on page load, run your code in the Form’s `show` event handler, rather than its **init** method.

## [Button](#button)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#Button_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#Button_events)

This is an Anvil button.

```python
b = Button(text="This is a button")
```

## [Label](#label)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#Label_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#Label_events)

Labels are useful for displaying text on a Form. The user cannot edit text in a Label.

```python
c = Label(text="This is a label")
```

## [Link](#link)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#Link_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#Link_events)

Links allow users to navigate to different parts of your app, or to other websites entirely. If a Link’s `url` property is set, it will open that URL in a new browser tab.

```python
c = Link(text="This is a Link",
         url="https://anvil.works")
self.add_component(c)
```

If a Link’s `url` property is not set, it will not open a new page when it is clicked. It will, however, still trigger the `click` event.

```python
c = Link(text="Click me")
c.add_event_handler('click', ...)
```

If a Link’s `url` property is set to a [Media object](/docs/working-with-files/media), it will open or download that media in a new tab.

```python
m = anvil.BlobMedia('text/plain', b'Hello, world!', name='hello.txt')
c = Link(text='Open text document', url=m)
```

You can Link to another Form by setting the `click` event handler to run `open_form` on an instance of the Form you want to open.

```python
def link_1_click(self, **event_args):
  """This method is called when the link is clicked"""
  form1 = Form1()
  open_form(form1)
```

### Making any component clickable using a Link

A Link is a [container](./containers) and inherits from the [column panel](./containers#columnpanel), which means it can contain other components. This allows you to make any component clickable by putting it in a Link and creating an event handler for the Link’s `click` event. This is a similar principle to surrounding something in an `<a>` tag in HTML.

## [CheckBox](#checkbox)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#CheckBox_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#CheckBox_events)

A CheckBox allows a boolean choice - checked or unchecked.

```python
c1 = CheckBox(text="Option 1", checked=True)
c2 = CheckBox(text="Option 2", checked=False)
```

A CheckBox can support a third state, `checked=None`, also known as indeterminate.

```python
c3 = CheckBox(text="Option 3", checked=None, allow_indeterminate=True)
```

When a user interacts with a CheckBox the state will toggle between `checked=True` and `checked=False`. The `checked=None` state can only set in code or with a databinding. If `allow_indeterminate` is not set to `True` then `checked=None` is equivalent to `checked=False`.

## [RadioButton](#radiobutton)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#RadioButton_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#RadioButton_events)

RadioButtons force users to select exactly **one option** from a list.

```python
rb1 = RadioButton(text="Select this option")
```

RadioButtons can be divided into groups by setting the `group_name` property. The user can select one option from each group. (If you don’t set `group_name`, then all your radio buttons will be in the default group.)

You can either find out each individual RadioButton’s status by accessing the `selected` property, or you can call the `get_group_value()` method to find out which button in that group is pressed. (`get_group_value()` will return the `value` property of the currently selected RadioButton in that group. If there are multiple RadioButtons in the same group with the same `value`, then you can’t tell them apart this way!)

```python
rb1.group_name = "mygroup"
rb1.value = "A"

rb2 = RadioButton(text="Or select this one", group_name="mygroup", value="B")

# Add these radio buttons to the Form
self.add_component(rb1)
self.add_component(rb2)

rb1.selected = True
print(rb1.get_group_value())  # prints A

rb2.selected = True # This will deselect the other button
print(rb2.get_group_value())  # prints B
```

## [DropDown](#dropdown)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#DropDown_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#DropDown_events)

This is an Anvil drop-down.

Drag and drop onto your Form and set the items (the options that populate the menu) in the Properties Panel, with each item on a separate line.

Or create one in code with the `DropDown` constructor:

```python
# Create a DropDown

b = DropDown(items=["Item 1", "Item 2"])
```

The `items` property can be a list of strings (`["One", "Two", "Three"]`), or a list of 2-tuples (`[("First Option", 0), ("Second Option", 1)]`).

If you use a list of strings, the `selected_value` property always returns the currently selected string.

If you use a list of 2-tuples (`[("First Option", 0), ("Second Option", 1)]`), the first element of each tuple is displayed in the drop down box. When an item in the DropDown list is selected, the *second* element of the tuple becomes the `selected_value` property of the DropDown. This is particularly useful if you wish to, for instance, choose from a list of Data Table rows:

```python
# Assuming the "people" table has at least columns "name" and "age":

self.drop_down_1.items = [(r["name"],r) for r in app_tables.people.search()]

# Later, probably in the DropDown 'change' event handler:

row = self.drop_down_1.selected_value
self.lbl_name.text = row["name"]
self.lbl_age.text = row["age"]
```

If you set the DropDown’s `include_placeholder` property to `True`, then the drop-down will display an extra option. That option corresponds to a `selected_value` of `None`. So the following code will display “Choose a person…”, in addition to whatever `items` you have specified:

```python
self.drop_down_1.include_placeholder = True
self.drop_down_1.placeholder = "Choose a person..."
self.drop_down_1.selected_value = None
```

DropDown `items` are updated in the UI when the `items` property is set or updated using the `=` operator. If you’re using `append` to construct a new `items` list, run the `=` operator to make the change live:

```python
# Construct a list of items
self.drop_down_1.items = []
for lunch in ['burger', 'burrito', 'bolognese']:
  self.drop_down_1.items.append(lunch)

# Make the new list live in the UI
self.drop_down_1.items = self.drop_down_1.items
```

## [DatePicker](#datepicker)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#DatePicker_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#DatePicker_events)

The DatePicker allows users of your app to select dates and times from a drop-down calendar.

```python
c = DatePicker()
```

The `date` property allows you to get and set the displayed date. Whatever you set it to, it will always return a `datetime.date` or `datetime.datetime` object, depending on the value of the `pick_time` property. You may set the `date` property in any of the following ways:

-   To a string in the format specified by the `format` property
-   To an ISO8601-formatted date
-   To a `datetime.date` object
-   To a `datetime.datetime` object (if `pick_time` is `True`)
-   To the string `"now"`, causing the DatePicker to display the current time when it is loaded.

```python
c = DatePicker(format="%d %m %Y")

# Set to a string
c.date = "27 09 2016"

# Set to an ISO string
c.date = "2016-09-27"

# Set to a datetime.date
import datetime
c.date = datetime.date.today()

# Set to a datetime.datetime
c.pick_time = True
c.date = datetime.datetime.now()
```

The `min_date` and `max_date` properties can be set in the same ways.

When the `pick_time` property is `True`, `date` expects and returns a `datetime.datetime` object. Otherwise it expects and returns a `datetime.date` object.

When selecting times, the returned `datetime.datetime` object has its timezone (`tzinfo`) explicitly set to the timezone of the user’s browser. Read more about timezones in Anvil [here](/docs/server#advanced).

Set a DatePicker to have focus by calling its `focus()` method. Select all its text with the `select()` method.

Some actions can only be performed [after a component is added to the web page](/docs/client/components#events) in the browser. A TextBox’s `focus()` and `select()` methods should be called from its `show` event.

## [TextBox](#textbox)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#TextBox_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#TextBox_events)

TextBoxes allow users to edit text on your Forms.

```python
c = TextBox(text="Some editable text")
```

A TextBox can only accept a single line of text. If you want to accept multiple lines of input, use a [TextArea](#textarea)

Set a TextBox to have focus by calling its `focus()` method. Select all its text with the `select()` method.

Some actions can only be performed [after a component is added to the web page](/docs/client/components#events) in the browser. A TextBox’s `focus()` and `select()` methods should be called from its `show` event.

The `type` property of a TextBox is a hint to the browser, which may constrain or suggest how to edit a text box (for example, only allowing digits in a `number` TextBox, or displaying a dial-pad when editing a `tel` TextBox).

When a TextBox’s `type` property is set to `"number"`, its `text` property will always return either a number or `None`.

The `text` property of a TextBox can trigger write-back of [Data Bindings](/docs/client/component-properties/data-bindings). This occurs before the `lost_focus` and `pressed_enter` events.

## [TextArea](#textarea)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#TextArea_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#TextArea_events)

TextAreas are text boxes that can contain multiple lines of text.

```python
c = TextArea(text="Some editable text\nacross multiple lines")
```

Set a TextArea to have focus by calling its `focus()` method. Select all its text with the `select()` method.

Some actions can only be performed [after a component is added to the web page](/docs/client/components#events) in the browser. A TextArea’s `focus()` and `select()` methods should be called from its `show` event.

The `text` property of a TextArea can trigger write-back of [Data Bindings](/docs/client/component-properties/data-bindings). This occurs before the `lost_focus` event.

## [Timer](#timer)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#Timer_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#Timer_events)

The Timer raises its `tick` event repeatedly, waiting a specified length of time in between each event.

Set the `interval` property to specify the wait time in seconds.

```python
c = Timer(interval=0.1)
```

This allows you to run a particular piece of code repeatedly (for example, updating an animation).

To stop the Timer, set `interval` to `0`:

```python
# Stop self.timer_1 from raising its tick event
self.timer_1.interval = 0
```

The Timer is an invisible component, meaning that users will not see it on the page when you run the app.

## [Spacer](#spacer)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#Spacer_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#Spacer_events)

Spacers add empty space to a Form.

Use them to fill a column with blank space, or to make vertical space on your Form.

```python
c = Spacer(height=50)
```

## [Image](#image)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#Image_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#Image_events)

Image components display an image on a Form.

To manipulate images, see [the Image module](/docs/working-with-files/media/image-manipulation).

You can set the `source` property from the Properties Panel by clicking the upload button and selecting an image from your machine. This will add the picture to your [App’s assets](/docs/client/customisation#adding-your-own-asset-files) and set the component’s source to the [asset file URL](/docs/client/customisation#asset-file-url).

Alternatively, you can choose which image to display in an Image Component by setting its `source` property in code. If this is set to a string, the image will be loaded from a URL given by that string.

```python
c = Image(source="http://www.example.com/image.jpg")
```

You can also work with images in code using [Media objects](/docs/working-with-files/media). For example, [Google Drive files](/docs/integrations/google/google-drive#drive-app-files) are Media objects, so you can display an image from Google Drive directly in an `Image` component.

```python
c.source = anvil.google.drive.app_files.my_image_jpg
```

If you read the `source` property of an Image, you will always see a Media object, even if you set it to a string. (Anvil automatically generates a `URLMedia` object for that URL.)

## [FileLoader](#fileloader)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#FileLoader_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#FileLoader_events)

A FileLoader allows you to load files from your computer or mobile device into an Anvil app.

```python
c = FileLoader()
```

The currently selected file in a FileLoader can be accessed from the `file` property. It is a [Media object](/docs/working-with-files/media), so you can use it to display images, upload files to Google Drive, and so on.

```python
if c.file != None:
    self.my_image.source = c.file
```

The `files` attribute gives a list of files. If the `multiple` property is set to `True`, then multiple files may be loaded; otherwise this list will always either be empty or contain one element.

The FileLoader’s `change` event is raised when a user selects a file. Its `file` argument is a [Media object](/docs/working-with-files/media) containing the chosen file.

```python
  def file_loader_1_change(self, file, **event_args):
    """This method is called when a new file is loaded into this FileLoader"""
    # Display this file in an Image component
    self.image_1.source = file
```

The file is loaded into the user’s browser; it does not get sent to the server side automatically. You can pass it into a server function to get it into a [Server Module](/docs/server) (since it is a [Media object](/docs/working-with-files/media), it will be streamed):

```python
  def file_loader_1_change(self, file, **event_args):
    # Upload the selected file into a Server Module
    result = anvil.server.call('my_image_classifier', file)
```

You can also store it in a [Data Table](../../data-tables):

```python
  def file_loader_1_change(self, file, **event_args):
    # Upload the selected file into a Data Table
    app_tables.my_files.add_row(name=file.name, media_obj=file)
```

To reset the FileLoader and make it ready to receive more files, call its `clear()` method.

```python
c.clear()
```

### File Types

By default, a FileLoader accepts all file types. To restrict this, set the `file_types` property using [unique file type specifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file#unique_file_type_specifiers).

```python
# Upload only image files
c = FileLoader(file_types='image/*')

# Upload only PDFs and Word documents
c = FileLoader(file_types='.pdf,.doc,.docx')
```

### Capturing images and video from the user’s device

On mobile devices, browsers offer additional options to capture images or video directly from the device’s camera or to upload from the photo gallery. The available capture and file selection options depend on the specified [file types](#file-types).

## [YouTube video](#youtube-video)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#YouTubeVideo_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#YouTubeVideo_events)

You can display YouTube videos with the YouTubeVideo component.

```python
ytv = YouTubeVideo(youtube_id="cbP2N1BQdYc", autoplay=True)
```

YouTube videos can be paused, played and stopped using the `pause()`, `play()` and `stop()` methods.

You can get and set the current position of the YouTube video using `current_time`.

There is a `state_change` event that gets raised when the video is paused, played or stopped.
