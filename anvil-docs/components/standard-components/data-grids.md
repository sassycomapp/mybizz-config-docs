# [Data Grids](#data-grids)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#DataGrid_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#DataGrid_events)

[Tutorial: Display Data in Tables](/learn/tutorials/data-grids)

The DataGrid component is great for displaying tabular data from any source. Create a DataGrid by dragging and dropping it into the the Form Editor from the [Toolbox](/docs/editor/form-editor#toolbox).

Or you can create one [in code](#manipulating-data-grids-using-code).

Get hands-on practice with Data Grids in our [Data Grid Tutorial](/learn/tutorials/data-grids).

## [Default Data Grid structure](#default-data-grid-structure)

When you drag and drop a Data Grid onto your Form, Anvil creates several components for you. Inside your DataGrid is a [RepeatingPanel](repeating-panel), and inside that are DataRowPanels - one for each item in the RepeatingPanel.

For example, if you create a new app and drop a DataGrid into Form1, you will have `self.data_grid_1`, which contains `self.repeating_panel_1`, whose template (`RowTemplate1`) inherits from [DataRowPanel](containers#datarowpanel).

-   The outer DataGrid is where you define the columns.
-   The RepeatingPanel inside the DataGrid is where you display rows of data.
-   The DataRowPanel is where you define the components that make up each row of your DataGrid.

## [The `DataGrid` component](#the-datagrid-component)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#DataGrid_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#DataGrid_events)

The DataGrid is a container for displaying tabular data. It specifies a set of columns, allocates space for each column, and has the option of displaying column headers. The DataGrid will expand vertically to fit its contents. If the data exceeds the number of rows that can fit on one page, the DataGrid will automatically add [pagination](#controlling-pagination), and links for navigating between pages.

### Creating a Data Grid

You can drag and drop a Data Grid onto your Form from the Design View of the [Form Editor](/docs/editor#form-editor). This will create the [default structure](#default-data-grid-structure) for you, including the inner RepeatingPanel and DataRowPanels.

You can also create `DataGrids` [in code](#manipulating-data-grids-using-code).

### Columns

To add new columns to your DataGrid component, selecting it and click on the `+` icon in the inline editing menu.

You can select columns to modify them from the [Properties Panel](/docs/editor/form-editor#properties-panel).

The `Expand` property is used to create a column that can expand, but that will never get smaller than the width specified. The width becomes a fixed minimum width if `Expand` is selected.

You can also define the columns [in code](#manipulating-data-grids-using-code).

## [The RepeatingPanel component](#the-repeatingpanel-component)

Dragging and dropping a Data Grid onto a Form creates a RepeatingPanel inside that Data Grid [by default](#default-data-grid-structure). You can also add RepeatingPanel(s) to an existing Data Grid.

The RepeatingPanel allows you to display one row in your table for each entry in a list (or other iterable object). This is done by setting the RepeatingPanel’s `items` property:

```python
self.repeating_panel_1.items = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'address': '1 Road Street'},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'address': '2 City Town'}
]
```

The items don’t have to be dictionaries, they can be anything with a `__getitem__` (that is, anything that you can use square brackets on in this way: `item['address']`. This could be a row from your [Data Tables](/docs/data-tables).)

### The RepeatingPanel uses a template

For each entry in the `items` property, the RepeatingPanel renders a template. The template is a Form that is automatically created for you and called something like `RowTemplate1`.

Each instance of the template is passed one of the entries of the RepeatingPanel’s `items` property. You can access this in code as `self.item` within the row template.

If the keys of the RepeatingPanel’s `items` property match the Keys of your Data Grid’s columns (set in the [Anvil Editor](/docs/editor) using the [Properties Panel](/docs/editor/form-editor#properties-panel)), then the values in `self.item` will go into the columns with a matching Key.

For precise details on how to display things inside the row template, follow the [display rules](#display-rules) that apply to DataRowPanels ([see below](#display-rules) for the rules).

Row templates inherit from `DataRowPanel` so the way you configure their display behaviour is the same as for [DataRowPanels](#the-datarowpanel-component).

To see a worked example, see [below](#simple-example) or read our [Data Grids Tutorial](/learn/tutorials/data-grids)

### Efficient Pagination

RepeatingPanels also contain special logic that cooperates with DataGrids to support lazy pagination: The RepeatingPanel will only iterate as far in its `items` property as it needs to display the current page. This allows you to load data on-demand as you browse a DataGrid.

If you want to improve the loading speed of your DataGrid, consider creating a lazily iterable object and using it to drive a RepeatingPanel to display your data.

## [The `DataRowPanel` component](#the-datarowpanel-component)

[Properties](/docs/api/anvil#DataRowPanel_attributes) | [Events](/docs/api/anvil#DataRowPanel_events)

The DataRowPanel component is a special container, designed to work with the DataGrid component. In particular, DataRowPanels understand the column-based layout of their parent DataGrids, so they can arrange their child components appropriately.

### In the default Data Grid structure

The DataRowPanel is part of the default structure of a Data Grid. The RepeatingPanel’s template (`RowTemplate1` here) inherits from DataRowPanel, so it behaves as one. All the rules in this section apply to row templates. See the section on the [default Data Grid structure](#default-data-grid-structure) for a full explanation.

You can access the template by double-clicking on a row in your Data Grid.

### Display Rules

There are three ways to display things on a DataRowPanel:

#### 1. Default display

Data is automatically displayed in DataRowPanels based on the column keys. For example, if your RepeatingPanel’s `items` are set to:

```python
self.repeating_panel_1.items = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'address': '1 Road Street'},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'address': '2 City Town'}
]
```

And you have two columns with their respective `data_key` properties set to `name` and `address`, then the `'name'` is displayed in the column whose Key is `name`, and the `'address'` is displayed in the column whose Key is `address`.

If you use a non-string value in the dictionary, the DataRowPanel calls `str()` on it before displaying it.

If you don’t want your data automatically displayed in this way, you can set the DataRowPanel’s `auto_display_data` property to `False`. If you want to automatically display data for some columns but not others, you can use display options 2) or 3) below to customise your DataRowPanel.

#### 2. Add components to columns

You can also add components to the columns of a DataRowPanel using drag and drop.

For example, if your RepeatingPanel’s `items` are set to:

```python
self.repeating_panel_1.items = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'address': '1 Road Street'},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'address': '2 City Town'}
]
```

You have two columns with their respective `data_key` properties set to `name` and `address`, and you drop a TextBox component called `text_box_1` into your ‘Name’ column.

You can use `self.item` from within RowTemplate1 (which is an entry from the [RepeatingPanel’s `items` property](#the-repeatingpanel-component)) to display data in the TextBox:

```python
class RowTemplate1(RowTemplate1Template):

  def __init__(self, **properties):
    # Set Form properties and Data Bindings.
    super().__init__(**properties)

    # Display names in text_box_1
    self.text_box_1.text = self.item['name']
```

We have used `self.item` to display data in the TextBoxes in the example above to demonstrate using `self.item` from code. In practice, the best way to link components to data is using [Data Bindings](/docs/client/component-properties/data-bindings). This is shown in the [example](#simple-example) below.

#### 3. Add full-width components

You can add full-width components to a DataRowPanel in Design View of the [Form Editor](/docs/editor#form-editor).

If you add both column and full-width components to the **same DataRowPanel**, the column components will appear above the full-width components.

## [Controlling pagination](#controlling-pagination)

Data Grids are paginated by default, meaning they will only display some of their rows at one time. Use the page controls in the bottom right of the Data Grid to navigate between pages of data. Edit the `rows_per_page` property to adjust how many rows to display at once. Setting it to `0` or `None` will disable pagination and display all rows.

### Pinning rows

If you want to keep a particular row or rows visible when the page is turned, you can use the DataRowPanel’s `pinned` property. The `pinned` property can be found in the “Container Properties” section of the [Properties Panel](/docs/editor/form-editor#properties-panel).

This will cause the DataRowPanel to be displayed on all pages of data, which is useful for creating headers or summary rows. Pinned rows will still contribute to the row count, so if you have `1` pinned row and you want to display `5` non-pinned rows, you must set `rows_per_page` to `6`.

## [Displaying a Data Table in a Data Grid](#displaying-a-data-table-in-a-data-grid)

Data Grids combine particularly well with [Data Tables](/docs/data-tables). You can display a Data Table in a Data Grid by assigning the `items` property of a RepeatingPanel to a Data Table `search()`.

For example, if you have a Data Table called ‘people’:

```python
self.repeating_panel_1.items = app_tables.people.search()
```

This works because a Data Tables `search()` returns an iterable object of dictionary-like rows, which is exactly what the RepeatingPanel needs.

Each row of the Data Table will be a row of the Data Grid, and each column will go into the Data Grid column whose Key has the same name (the `name` column in your [Data Table](/docs/data-tables) will be displayed in the the Data Grid column whose Key is `name`, etc.).

Make sure you set the columns up to have the correct names - you can automatically link a Data Grid to your Data Table from the object palette. Click on the downward arrow next to the `+` button and select “`+ Columns from <name-of-data-table>`”.

## [Simple example](#simple-example)

Here is a simple example:

-   We start by using a RepeatingPanel in a Data Grid to display data from a Data Table.
-   We then customise the DataRowPanel (the template of the RepeatingPanel, called RowTemplate1), placing a `Link` component in the “Name” column, and setting its `text` property with a [Data Binding](/docs/client/component-properties/data-bindings).
-   We then make the DataRowPanel interactive, by adding code to pop up a dialog box when you click the link.
-   Finally, we can run the app to test it.

For more examples, read the [Data Grid tutorial](/learn/tutorials/data-grids).

## [Manipulating Data Grids using code](#manipulating-data-grids-using-code)

#### 1. Default display

You can also create your Data Grid using code:

```python
# Create your Data Grid
grid = DataGrid()
# Add the Data Grid to your Form
self.add_component(grid)
```

Creating a Data Grid from code does not create the [default structure](#default-data-grid-structure) for you - it **only creates the outer DataGrid**, and will not create a RepeatingPanel or DataRowPanels.

In Code view of the [Form Editor](/docs/editor#form-editor), you define the columns of the DataGrid by setting the `columns` property of the DataGrid. The `columns` property should be set to a list of Python dictionaries containing a unique ID, a data key (for use by DataRowPanels), and a title for the column header:

```python
# Add two columns to your Data Grid
grid.columns = [
  { "id": "A", "title": "Name", "data_key": "name" },
  { "id": "B", "title": "Address", "data_key": "address" },
]
```

The DataGrid updates its columns when the `columns` property is set. If you change the `columns` list in-place, you’ll need to trigger a refresh (e.g. by setting `grid.columns = grid.columns`).

Data Grids do not create a RepeatingPanel by default if created from code. First, create a RepeatingPanel and set its `item_template` to a DataRowPanel. Then, set the `items` property of your RepeatingPanel to your list (or other iterable). Finally, add the RepeatingPanel to your Data Grid:

```python
rp = RepeatingPanel(item_template=DataRowPanel)
# Set its items property
rp.items = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'address': '1 Road Street'},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'address': '2 City Town'}
]
# Add the repeating panel to your data grid
grid.add_component(rp)
```

You can also add rows to your Data Grid using a DataRowPanel. The `item` property of the DataRowPanel component specifies the data to display:

```python
row = DataRowPanel(item={'name': 'Samantha', 'address': '3 Green Lane'})
grid.add_component(row)
```

If `item` is a dictionary, each column gets the value that corresponds to its `data_key`.

You can also set the `item` property to objects other than dictionaries. The DataRowPanel looks up the `data_key` for each column using using `__getitem__()` (aka square-bracket lookup, e.g. `item['key']`). So the `item` can be anything that you can use square brackets on, for example a [Data Table row](/docs/data-tables).

#### 2. Add components to columns

You can also add components to columns with code. You specify which column you want to display your component in by passing the column’s `id` as the `column=` parameter to `add_component`:

```python
row = DataRowPanel()
textbox = TextBox(text="Alice")
# Add the textbox to the column with id "A"
row.add_component(textbox, column="A")
grid.add_component(row)
```

#### 3. Add full-width components

You can also add full-width components to your Data Grid from code. If you do not specify a `column` parameter to `add_component()` (or if you specify `column=None`), the component will occupy the full width of the container. This is great for section headers:

```python
# First add a full-width header
title_row = DataRowPanel()
title_row.add_component(Label(text="My Favourite People",
                              background='#dddddd',
                              bold=True,
                              align='center'))
grid.add_component(title_row)
```

### Pagination

You can set the `rows_per_page` property of your Data Grid to manage [pagination](#controlling-pagination) with code:

```python
# Display two rows per page
grid.rows_per_page = 2
```

### Pinning rows

If you want to keep a particular row or rows visible when the page is turned, you can use the DataRowPanel’s `pinned` property. You do this from code by passing `pinned=True` to `add_component()` when adding the DataRowPanel to the Data Grid:

```python
title_row = DataRowPanel()
title_row.add_component(Label(text="My Favourite People", ...))

grid.add_component(title_row, pinned=True)
```

## [Show and hide rows and columns](#show-and-hide-rows-and-columns)

Data Grid rows and columns can be shown and hidden programmatically.

### Rows

Hiding/showing a row is simply done by setting the `visible` property of the row in question.

```python
rows = self.repeating_panel_stocks.get_components()
rows[row_number].visible = False
```

### Columns

Hiding columns is done by modifying the Data Grid’s `columns` property. This is a list of columns; each column is represented as a dictionary. So to hide a column, remove a column from the list. Add it back to the list to show it again.

To make the change live, you must run the assignment (`=`) operator for the `columns` property.

Here’s how you hide a column:

```python
# Filter the column with title 'Stock Price' out of the columns list.
column = [c for c in self.data_grid_1.columns if c['title'] == 'Stock Price'][0]

# Remember the details of the hidden column
self.hidden_columns.append(column)

# Remove it from the Data Grid's column list
self.data_grid_stocks.columns.remove(column)

# Make the change live
self.data_grid_stocks.columns = self.data_grid_stocks.columns
```

And to show it again, you do the reverse:

```python
# Filter the column with title 'Stock Price' out of the hidden columns list.
column = [c for c in self.hidden_columns if c['title'] == 'Stock Price'][0]

# Remove it from the hidden columns list
self.hidden_columns.remove(column)

# Add it to the Data Grid's column list
self.data_grid_stocks.columns.append(column)

# Make the change live
self.data_grid_stocks.columns = self.data_grid_stocks.columns
```
