# [Scripts](#scripts)

**Scripts** in Anvil are single-file Python scripts that run from beginning to end, like a Python script on your computer. You can run a Script directly in the Anvil Editor, or run a Script from your [front-end user interface](../client).

Scripts execute in the trusted server environment, just like [Server Modules](server-modules). This means they can use any [packages you have installed](custom-packages).

Scripts are useful for one-off maintenance tasks (for example, seeding a database with sample data). You can also upload an existing Python script as an Anvil Script and add a [graphical user interface](../client) to share it with other people online.

## [Running Scripts in the Anvil Editor](#running-scripts-in-the-anvil-editor)

To run a Script in the Anvil Editor, open the Script and click the green **Run** button in the toolbar.

Your Script output will appear in the [bottom panel](../editor#bottom-panel). You can interrupt a running Script by clicking the stop button.

Scripts that you launch from the Anvil Editor can run for a maximum of 5 minutes.

## [Running Scripts from the Front End](#running-scripts-from-the-front-end)

By default, a Script can only be launched from the Anvil Editor or [from server code](#running-scripts-as-background-tasks). However, if you change the permission in the script editor, you can make the Script callable by anyone who visits your app, or by anyone who is logged in with the [Users Service](../users).

To launch a Script from front-end code, call `anvil.server.run_script('<script-name>')`. Any additional arguments to the `run_script()` function will be passed as arguments to your Script. If your Script returns a value, `run_script()` will return that value. If your Script raises an exception, `run_script()` will raise that exception.

For example, to call a Script when a Button called `button_1` is pressed, you might write:

```python
    @handle('button_1', 'click')
    def button_1_click(self, **event-args):
        """This method is called when the button is clicked"""
        anvil.server.run_script('MyScript')
```

## [Arguments and return values](#arguments-and-return-values)

To pass information to your Script when you launch it, you can pass additional arguments to `run_script()`. These arguments appear to the Script like standard Python command-line arguments (from `sys.argv`) or using `anvil.script.args` (requires `import anvil.script`). You cannot pass keyword arguments to a Script.

If your Script assigns a value to `anvil.script.return_value`, then that will become the Script’s return value, and will be returned from the `run_script()` call.

You can pass any [portable value](server-modules#valid-arguments-and-return-values) as an argument to a Script, and return any portable value except Media objects from a Script. This means you can upload files to your Script, and return rich data including [Plots](../components/standard-components/plots) or [database records](../data-tables).

### Example

For example, if you have a Script called `HelloWorld` with this code:

```python
import anvil.script

name = anvil.script.args[1]
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

anvil.script.return_value = f"Greeted {name}"
```

And if in client code you called:

```python
result = anvil.server.run_script('HelloWorld', 'Sophie')
alert(result)
```

Then when you ran that code you would see the Script print `Hello, Sophie!` on the App Console, and pop up an alert box that says **“Greeted Sophie”**.

## [Passing files as arguments to Scripts](#passing-files-as-arguments-to-scripts)

You can pass files as arguments to a Script. You can, for example, ask a user to upload a file with a [FileLoader](../components/standard-components/basic#fileloader) and pass it straight into a Script.

Files in Anvil are normally represented as [Media objects](../other-concepts/working-with-files/media), which give you access to filenames and MIME types as well as data. However, as a convenience, when you pass a Media object as an argument to a Script, the data is written to a temporary file and the filename of that temporary file appears in `sys.argv`. If you want direct access to the Media object, you can access it via `anvil.script.args`.

So if you want to read a file you’ve been passed as an argument, you can do either:

```python
import sys

open(sys.argv[1], 'rb')
```

…or, equivalently:

```python
import anvil.media
import anvil.script

with anvil.media.TempFile(anvil.script.args[0]) as f:
    open(f, 'rb')
```

### Returning files from Scripts

You can return any [portable value](server-modules#valid-arguments-and-return-values) from a Script, except Media objects.

You might want to return a file from your Script. However, because you can’t return a Media object directly from a Script. Instead, you’ll need to use [Data Tables](../data-tables): Create a table to hold these files, add a new row containing your file, then return the row itself from your script.

## [Running Scripts as Background Tasks](#running-scripts-as-background-tasks)

Every Script is available as a [Background Task](background-tasks), named `script:<name>`. So, for example, you can launch a Script called `MyScript` by calling `anvil.server.launch_background_task('script:MyScript')`.

Scripts can access `anvil.server.task_state`, just like any other Background Task, and that state can be retrieved by calling `get_state()` on the task object. See the [Background Tasks documentation](background-tasks) for details.

If you want to provide status updates while your Script is running - for example, to indicate progress - use `launch_background_task()` instead of `run_task()` and poll the task state and completion status in your own code.
