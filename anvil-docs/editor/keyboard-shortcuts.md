# [Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)

There are several keyboard shortcuts available in the Anvil Editor. If you are using a Mac, you can use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl` everywhere if you prefer, but you’ll need to use `Option` instead of `Alt`.

## [From Any Screen In the Editor](#from-any-screen-in-the-editor)

-   `Ctrl-B` — Open or close the [App Browser](https://anvil.works/docs/editor#app-browser) panel.
-   `Ctrl-Shift-F` — Search all code in the app.
-   `Ctrl-P` — Open the [Quick Switcher](https://anvil.works/docs/editor#zen-mode-and-quick-switcher) window to easily jump between tabs.
