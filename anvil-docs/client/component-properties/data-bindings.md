# [Data Bindings](#data-bindings)

Data Bindings are a way of keeping a component’s properties in sync with the underlying data with minimal effort. A Data Binding associates a property of a component with a single Python expression.

Data Bindings are set per property in the Properties Panel:

All bound properties for a particular Form are updated whenever:

-   `self.refresh_data_bindings()` is called, or
-   `super().__init__(**properties)` is called, or
-   the `self.item` for the Form is set.

If you use “Write back”, the values are written back:

-   when relevant input events such as `pressed_enter` or `lost_focus` are fired by the component

See [Two-way Data Bindings](#two-way-data-bindings) below for more details on “Write back”.

## [Creating a Data Binding](#creating-a-data-binding)

To create a Data Binding, find the property you want to bind in the Properties Panel, and click the icon next to the property name. You’ll then be able to write a Python expression. In the image below, the `text` property of a Label is bound to `self.item['name']`.

If you want to see all the Data Bindings that you’ve created for a form, select the form and scroll to the bottom of the properties panel.

With this Data Binding set up, every time `self.refresh_data_bindings()` is called, the `text` property would get set to `self.item['name']`.

Data Bindings can only access attributes and methods of `self` - they cannot access variables in the global scope. If you want to modify variables in the global scope, you can create methods on `self` that return the global variable you want to use (such methods are often called ‘accessor methods’ or ‘getters’).

If a Data Binding expression raises a `KeyError`, it is ignored. This allows you to bind empty or partially-filled dictionaries to a form.

## [The `item` property](#the-item-property)

As well as properties that relate to UI such as `spacing_above`, components have a special property meant specifically for storing data of any kind - `item`. This can be set to anything - a Data Tables row, a custom dictionary, any Python object (Remember, in Python “everything is an object”).

The `item` property is useful for Data Bindings because it’s a way for components to hold data and pass it around. Generally, you’ll want to set the `item` property to a Data Table row or a custom dictionary, and bind a component property to a key in the row or dictionary. The Data Bindings editor will autocomplete with keys from `self.item`.

Whenever the `self.item` of a Form changes, all Data Bindings for that Form are updated.

## [Two-way Data Bindings](#two-way-data-bindings)

For input components such as `TextBox` or `DatePicker`, Data Bindings can be two-way.

In order to make a data binding property two-way, toggle the button:

This means that when a user changes the property, the Python object it’s bound to will be updated as part of the processing of relevant events.

For example, binding the `text` property of a `TextBox` to `self.item['name']` means that `self.item['name']` will be set to whatever the user has entered in the `TextBox`, right before the `pressed_enter` or `lost_focus` events are processed.

Write Back does **not** trigger when `self.refresh_data_bindings()` is called, when `super().__init__(**properties)` is called or when the `self.item` for the Form is set. It **only** triggers when events such as `pressed_enter` fire on the relevant component.

## [Why are Data Bindings useful?](#why-are-data-bindings-useful)

To see why Data Bindings save effort, consider an app where the user enters a number `N` into a TextBox, presses a button, and a times table is displayed for that number (`N` is 4 in the image):

If you want your times tables to go up to 12 x `N`, you can create 12 Labels and bind each of their `text` properties to `1 * self.item['N']` (for the first one) through `12 * self.item['N']` (for the last one).

To set `N`, you can bind the `text` of the TextBox to `self.item['N']` with ‘Write back’ enabled. Then to update the Labels, just run `self.refresh_data_bindings()` when the Button is clicked.

```python
  def button_1_click(self, **event_args):
  """This method is called when the button is clicked"""
  	self.refresh_data_bindings()
```

This means your click handler is **just one line**. Without Data Bindings, this method would need 12 very similar lines like `self.text_box_3.text = 3 * self.item['N']`. Crucially, the definition of what the Labels *mean* is kept with the Label, rather than being defined in the Button’s click handler.

On top of that, if you want to have multiple ways of updating the Labels, you don’t have to reproduce the definitions of what the Labels mean. Let’s say you wanted to make the times tables change when somebody sends an SMS to the app. Instead of copying all those `self.text_box_3.text = 3 * self.item['N']` lines into the SMS handler, you can just make it do `self.refresh_data_bindings()` and everything will be updated appropriately.

## [Equivalent functionality from code](#equivalent-functionality-from-code)

Data Bindings are a function of Forms in the visual designer. If you want to accomplish the same functionality in code, you can use event handlers.

The form’s `refreshing_data_bindings` event handler will be called whenever Data Bindings are refreshed. You can access a Form’s `refreshing_data_bindings` event handler by selecting your Form in the designer, and heading to the ‘container properties’ section of the Properties Panel:

Clicking the blue arrows next to the box will create the `form_refreshing_data_bindings` event handler, and take you to the function in Code View. Any code you write here will run at the same time as any Data Bindings specified in the designer. For example, the following is equivalent to a Data Binding to a text box:

```python
  def form_refreshing_data_bindings(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when refreshing_data_bindings is called"""
    
    self.text_box_1.text = self.item['my_text']
```

If you want to write back data when the text box changes, you can do this with its `change` event handler:

```python
  def text_box_1_change(self, **event_args):
    """This method is called when the text in this text box is edited"""

    self.item['my_text'] = self.text_box_1.text
```

In fact, the above code is not *quite* equivalent to a Data Binding, because it does not ignore KeyErrors. You can, of course, do this yourself with a `try`/`except` block.
