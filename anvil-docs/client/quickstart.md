# [Quickstart: User Interfaces](#quickstart-user-interfaces)

### Build your UI visually and write Python to make it work

Anvil allows you to build user interfaces quickly with its drag-and-drop editor. You can also write client-side Python code to set up user interface behaviour.

Follow this quickstart to build a page with a TextBox and a Button and greet the user!

## [Create an app](#create-an-app)

Log in to Anvil and click ‘New Blank App’. Choose the Material Design theme.

## [Add components](#add-components)

You will see your app in the centre of the screen. On the right is the Toolbox, which contains components to drag-and-drop.

Drop a TextBox and Button into the page.

## [Change component properties](#change-component-properties)

Select the Button you just added to the page. Then modify the text on the Button by either double clicking the Button’s text in the designer or editing the text in the Properties Panel below the Toolbox.

Change it from `button_1` to `Say Hello`.

## [Set up an event handler](#set-up-an-event-handler)

Now click the `on` **click** `event` button in the [Object Palette](/docs/editor/form-editor#object-palette).

The `on` **click** `event` button

## [Write some Python](#write-some-python)

You will be taken to the Code View. This is Python that runs in the browser. The `button_1_click` method runs when the Button is clicked.

Replace the `pass` with this code:

```python
    self.button_1.text = f"Hello {self.text_box_1.text}!"
```

## [Run your app](#run-your-app)

Now click the ‘Run’ button at the top of the screen.

You’ll see your app running. Enter your name into the TextBox and click the Button. The Button text will change to greet you!

## [Copy the example app](#copy-the-example-app)

Click on the button below to clone a finished version of this app into your account.
