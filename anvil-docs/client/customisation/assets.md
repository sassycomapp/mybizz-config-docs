# [Adding Assets](#adding-assets)

Assets are files that are part of your app’s source code, such as CSS files, JavaScript, or images. They’re primarily used to customise your app’s [Theme](/docs/client/themes-and-styling) or inject your own [JavaScript objects](/docs/client/customisation/javascript).

To upload or create a file, click on **Create or upload Asset** under “Assets” in the [App Browser](/docs/editor#app-browser). This will bring up a menu for creating or uploading new Assets.

Most assets are lazily loaded when running the app, except for html files and the `theme.css` file, which are eagerly loaded.

## [Asset file URL](#asset-file-url)

You can access Asset files from your app from `_/theme/<filename>`.

This allows you do things like setting your asset as the source property of an Image component:

Or call a custom script from an HTML file:

```python
<script type="text/javascript" src="_/theme/custom.js"></script>
```

You can also use the full URL of the Asset file – they are hosted at `<your-app-url>/_/theme/<filename>`. So if you have an asset named `earthrise.jpg` in an app published at `myapp.anvil.app`, your file is hosted at `https://myapp.anvil.app/_/theme/earthrise.jpg`.
