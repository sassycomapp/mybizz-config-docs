# [Containers](#containers)

Some components can contain other components. We call these containers, and they all inherit from the `Container` class. (All Forms are also containers.)

For a full list of container components, see [Components: Containers](/docs/ui/components/containers).

You can add a component to a container in Python by calling the container’s `add_component()` method.

```python
btn = Button()

self.linear_panel_1.add_component(btn)
```

You can call a container’s `get_components()` method to get a list of all the components that have been added to it.

## [Parents and children](#parents-and-children)

You can look up a component’s container with the `.parent` attribute. If a component has not yet been added to a container, its `.parent` attribute is `None`.

```python
print(btn.parent)
# prints "<anvil.XYPanel object>" for a button inside an XY Panel
```

Try to avoid using multiple `.parent` attributes chained together to go up the component hierarchy.

You will probably find your code is more robust if you use `get_open_form()` to get a reference to the [currently-open Form](/docs/client/forms#the-top-level-form) and find the component you’re looking for from there.

## [Removing components](#removing-components)

To remove a component from a container, call the component’s `remove_from_parent()` method.

```python
btn.remove_from_parent()
```

To remove *all* components from a container, call the container’s `clear()` method.

```python
self.xy_panel_1.clear()
```

## [Raising an event on all children](#raising-an-event-on-all-children)

To raise an [event](/docs/client/events) on all components in a container, call the `raise_event_on_children` method

```python
container.raise_event_on_children(event_name, extra_args)
```

This takes exactly the same parameters as `component.raise_event`, and is subject to the same constraints on event names.

It is especially useful when you want to signal to all children of a RepeatingPanel without already having explicit references to those children.

## [Container Properties](#container-properties)

Container Properties are properties that control the relationship between a component and the container it is in; the argument names and their meanings depend on the type of container. They are visible in the Properties Panel in the Anvil Editor. They can also be passed as keyword arguments to `add_component`.

For example, components added to XYPanels have `x`, `y`, and `width` properties, which determine the position of the component. You can specify them in the designer:

Or you can pass them as keyword arguments when you call `add_component()` in your code:

```python
btn = Button(text="Click me")
self.xy_panel_1.add_component(btn, x=100, y=100)
```

For more information on the container properties available for each container type, consult the Anvil [API Reference](/docs/api/anvil).
