# [Quickstart: Making PDFs](#quickstart-making-pdfs)

### Build your UI visually and render it as a PDF

Anvil has built-in support for creating PDFs.

Follow this quickstart to create your visual design with drag-and-drop, accept user inputs and then render them in PDF format.

## [Create an app](#create-an-app)

Log in to Anvil and click ‘New Blank App’. Choose the Material Design theme.

## [Add components](#add-components)

You will see your app in the centre of the screen. On the right is the Toolbox, which contains components to drag-and-drop.

Drop a TextBox, FileLoader and Button into the page.

## [Change component properties](#change-component-properties)

Select the Button you just added to the page. In the Object Palette floating above the Button, click the icon to change the Button’s text from ‘button\_1’ to ‘Print’. You can also edit the text from the Properties Panel on the right.

## [Add another Form](#add-another-form)

In the App Browser, click the ‘+ Add Form’ next to ‘Client Code’,then select ‘Standard Page’. You’ll now have a second Form called ‘Form2’.

## [Design your PDF](#design-your-pdf)

Drop a Label and Image into the page. Form2 will be the template for our PDF. We’ll display a greeting in the Label and an Image uploaded by the user.

## [Write some Python](#write-some-python)

Go to Code View of Form2. This is Python that runs in the browser.

Edit the definition of the `__init__` function to accept a name and image. It now looks like this:

```python
  def __init__(self, name, img, **properties):
	# ... rest of code as before ...
```

We want to display a greeting in `self.label_1`, and an image in `self.image_1`. Edit our Form2’s `__init__` method as follows:

```python
    # Any code you write here will run before the form opens.
    self.label_1.text = f"Hello, {name}!"
    self.image_1.source = img
```

## [Add a Server Module](#add-a-server-module)

In the App Browser, click the ‘+ Add Server Module’ to add a new Server Module.

You will see a code editor with an orange background. This is a server-side Python environment for your app.

## [Write a server function](#write-a-server-function)

Add this line to the top of your Server Module:

```python
import anvil.pdf
```

Write this function into the Server Module:

```python
def create_pdf(name, img):
  # Create a pdf from 'Form2', and pass in 'name' and 'img' as its constructors
  pdf = anvil.pdf.render_form("Form2", name, img)
  return pdf
```

## [Make your function client-callable](#make-your-function-client-callable)

Above your `create_pdf` function, add `@anvil.server.callable`. The function now looks like this:

```python
@anvil.server.callable
def create_pdf(name, img):
  pdf = anvil.pdf.render_form("Form2", name, img)
  return pdf
```

That makes the `create_pdf` function callable from the client side.

## [Set up an event handler](#set-up-an-event-handler)

Under Forms in the App Browser, select Form1, then select the ‘Print’ Button. In the Object Palette floating above the Button, click `on click event`. This will create a function that will run when a user clicks the Button.

## [Write some more Python](#write-some-more-python)

You will be taken to the Code View. The `button_1_click` method runs when the Button is clicked.

Replace the `pass` with this code:

```python
    import anvil.media

    pdf = anvil.server.call('create_pdf', self.text_box_1.text, self.file_loader_1.file)
    anvil.media.download(pdf)
```

## [Run your app](#run-your-app)

Now click the ‘Run’ button at the top of the screen.

You’ll see your app running. Enter your name in the TextBox, then click the ‘upload’ button - you will get a file selection dialog.

Choose an image to upload, then click the ‘Print’ button.

Your app will pop up a dialog for you to download your completed PDF!

## [Copy the example app](#copy-the-example-app)

Click on the button below to clone a finished version of this app into your account.
