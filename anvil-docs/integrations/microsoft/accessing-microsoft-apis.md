# [Accessing Microsoft Azure APIs](#accessing-microsoft-azure-apis)

Microsoft provides a huge range of REST APIs to give you machine-readable access to Azure services. The full list at the time of writing is [further down this page](#full-list-of-microsoft-rest-apis).

For documentation on any particular Microsoft Azure REST API, head to [the Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/).

## [Using Microsoft Azure APIs from Anvil](#using-microsoft-azure-apis-from-anvil)

Anvil gives you an OAuth token you can use to access Microsoft APIs from client-side or server-side code.

You need to link Anvil to your Azure account as described in [Connecting Azure to Anvil](linking-azure-and-anvil). It only takes a few minutes.

Once you’ve done that, you can allow users to log in with their Microsoft accounts by calling this function from the client side code:

```python
anvil.microsoft.auth.login()
```

You can get a Microsoft API token for the currently logged-in user by calling [`anvil.microsoft.auth.get_user_access_token()`](/docs/api/anvil.microsoft.auth#get_user_access_token) in client-side or server-side code:

```python
token = anvil.microsoft.auth.get_user_access_token()
```

You can use the [`anvil.http` library](/docs/http-apis/making-http-requests) to make HTTP requests against your chosen API. You can do this from client-side or server-side code. Put your API token in an `Authorization` header, as in the following example:

```python
    import anvil.http

    anvil.microsoft.auth.login()
    token = anvil.microsoft.auth.get_user_access_token()

    me = anvil.http.request(
      'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/',
      headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'},
      json=True,
    )
    self.headline_1.text = f"Hello, {me['displayName']}!"
```

This example uses the [Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) API, which allows you to access a range of Microsoft 365 application data such as user accounts, calendar events and emails. Here we’ve used it to display the user’s real name in our Anvil app.

## [OAuth Scopes](#oauth-scopes)

Many of the Microsoft Azure REST APIs require you to request particular OAuth scopes to gain access.

OAuth scopes are particular sets of permissions that you request when logging in. The API token becomes associated with those scopes, so once your user has logged in, you can use the token to make any API requests allowed under the scopes you’ve requested.

To set up the scopes you wish to request, go to the Microsoft API Service in the Anvil Editor and select ‘Yes’ under ‘Request extra OAuth Scopes’. You can then enter any number of OAuth scopes in the text box. To request multiple scopes, enter each scope **separated by a space**.

In our example, making a GET request to `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/` requires the `User.Read` scope, so we have instructed Anvil to request it.

## [Next up](#next-up)

You can also use the Microsoft API Service for user authentication and authorization. Read [Microsoft Single Sign-On](microsoft-single-sign-on) to log users in with their global Microsoft accounts or [Connecting Entra ID to Anvil](linking-azure-and-anvil) to restrict access to users within your organization.
