# [TLS Certificates](#tls-certificates)

You have a choice of using an Anvil-supplied service to perform HTTPS termination, or using your own infrastructure (e.g. an HTTP load balancer).

### Terminate HTTPS with Anvil (Default)

You will need certificates for each of your chosen domain names, or one certificate that covers all of them. If Anvil will only be accessible internally on your network, then certificates signed by your private CA will work just fine.

Please make sure the certificates and private keys are available in full-chain PEM format. Refer to the [AWS EKS guide](../kubernetes/eks#domain-names-and-tls-certificates) if you are deploying to EKS.

If you can’t get certificates easily and you’re deploying in [Kubernetes](../kubernetes), you can start without them. The [Anvil Operator](../operator) will automatically generate self-signed certificates to get you going. Of course, you’ll want to generate real certificates for a full production deployment.

### Terminate HTTPS in Your Own Infrastructure

Configure your HTTPS terminator to accept connections to each of your chosen domains, and forward them to the Anvil load balancer service. Anvil will expect your HTTPS terminator to populate the `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For` headers.

The exact details of this setup will depend on your deployment environment, so please contact the Anvil team if you’d like to use this option.
